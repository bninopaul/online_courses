1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,770
Hierarchical clustering is kind of a bread
and butter technique

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,720
when it comes to visualizing a high
dimensional or multidimensional data.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,520
It's very simple to use.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,590
The ideas are fairly intuitive for most
people,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,450
and it kind of, can serve as a really

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,720
quick way to get a sense of what's going
on in a very high dimensional data set.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,910
So, of course, like, like most clustering
techniques,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,350
for example, like, k-means for example the
basic issue

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,390
that you have to deal with, you know, when
you define the method is,

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,990
how do we define when things are close
together and when things are far apart?

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,320
Because all clustering methods in some
sense try to tell you

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,050
when one thing is closer to another thing,
versus something else.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,290
And so, for example, things that are, you
know, cluster are

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,450
closer to each other than they are to
elements of another cluster.

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,930
And so, we have to define what it means

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,580
to be close what it means to group things
together.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,640
How do we group things together?

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,630
And then once we've got, we have a
distance

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,260
notion, we have, and we have a way of
grouping

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,200
things together, how do we visualize the,
you know,

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,520
the processing that we've done, the
calculation that we've done?

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,890
And how do we interpret you know, how the
grouping is put together?

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,950
Cluster analysis is a really important and
widely used technique.

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,900
It's a, if you just type cluster analysis
into

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Google, there are literally millions of
results that come back.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,900
And it's a widely applied method in all,

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,270
in many different areas of science and
other applications.

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,370
And so it's useful to know kind of how
these techniques work.

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,410
So, hierarchical clustering as, as is
denoted by the

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,660
title involves organizing your data into a
kind of hierarchy.

31
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,820
And, and the common approach is

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,130
what's called an aglomer, and aglomerative
approach.

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,270
And the idea, it was just kind of a bottom
up approach, so you

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,220
start with the data as kind of individual
data points, and you start lumping

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,950
them together into clusters until
eventually you have, you

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,200
know, your entire data set is just one big
cluster.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,715
So you can imagine there's all these
little particles floating around,

38
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:53,950
and eventually you start kind of grouping
them together into little balls.

39
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,340
And then the balls get grouped up into
bigger balls, and

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,658
the bigger balls get grouped together into
one big massive cluster.

41
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:01,758
And so that's the kind of agglomerative
approach to clut,

42
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:05,210
to hierarchical clustering, and that's
what we're going to talk about here.

43
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,250
And so the basic idea is that you gotta
find the,

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,870
the two points in your data set that are
the closest together.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,810
And then, you kind of merge them together
to

46
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,970
create one, you know, super-point, so that
the merged point

47
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,770
is not an actual point in your data set,
but

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,800
you can think of it as being a new point.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,540
And then, you kind of remove your original
two data points,

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,960
and you substitute with that, or that kind
of, merged point.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,580
And you kind of repeat this over and over
again.

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,110
So, then, you find the next two closest
things, and you put them together.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,690
And then you, as you kind of, and then
once

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,360
you kind of put things together, you get
like a

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,900
little tree that you can show that
kind of, that

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,540
shows the ordering in which things were
put together.

57
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,040
And so this approach requires two
important things.

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,360
One is a distance metric.

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,989
So what is how do you calculate the
distance between two points?

60
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,780
And, the other thing that is required is
an approach for merging points.

61
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,090
So once you, once you've figured out, okay
well, these two points are the closest

62
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,780
how do you merge them together?

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,530
And so the nice thing that hierarchical
clustering produces is a, is a

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,690
tree which is sometimes called the
dendrogram

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,950
that shows how things are merged together.

66
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,470
And so the most important, arguably the
most

67
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,990
important question to really, to kind of
resolve

68
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,390
in a, in a hierarchical clustering
approach is

69
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,740
to define what do we mean by close.

70
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,250
Because if you have a definition that
doesn't

71
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,180
make sense for your problem then you just
get

72
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,510
garbage in, garbage out, right?

73
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,770
So you have a, a distance metric that
doesn't make

74
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,450
sense then the results that you get will
be relatively meaningless.

75
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,600
So there are a few examples of distance
metrics that are used out there.

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,570
Probably the most kind of familiar
distance metric is the Euclidean distance,

77
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,170
which is just kind of the straight-line
distance between any two points.

78
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,230
A kind of analogous distance metric is the
correlation between two points, or the

79
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,170
correlation similarity.

80
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,570
And then another metric is the binary
distance or, or the Manhattan distance,

81
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,030
and I'll, we'll talk a little bit about
what that means in a second.

82
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,510
So you have to make, you have to pick a
distance metric that's, makes

83
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,830
sense for your problem so that you can
produce results that also make sense.

84
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,610
And so, here's Euclidean distance, a
simple diagram.

85
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,368
So if you take two cities, for example,
Baltimore and D.C., or Washington D.C.,

86
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:19,430
then if you map, put them on a, on a, on a
map for example.

87
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,320
And there's, there's, so, you can imagine
that the center

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,230
of each city has an X and a Y coordinate.

89
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:29,160
And you want to say map the distance
between the two centers of the two cities.

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,800
well, you can draw a straight diagonal
line between the two cities.

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,170
And then, the you can calculate the
distance, kind of, in the usual way.

92
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,310
And the distance is going to be a function
of the difference

93
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,590
in the x coordinates and the difference in
the y coordinates.

94
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,810
So to calculate the Euclidian distance you
take the distance you know, in the x

95
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,220
coordinates, you square it, you take the
difference

96
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,190
in the y coordinates and you square it.

97
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,090
You add the two squares together, you take
the square root.

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,210
That's the classical definition of
Euclidian distance.

99
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,270
And so you can imagine, you know, in real
life, it'd be like

100
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,740
if a bird were to fly from DC to
Baltimore, they would just fly

101
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,230
straight from one city to another, they
could, because they can fly in

102
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,440
the air and they're not impeded by things
like roads or mountains, or whatever.

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,530
And so

104
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,790
that's the straight line distance between
two cities.

105
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,020
Whether that makes sense for you depends
on

106
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,460
you know, whether you're a bird or
something else.

107
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,840
And so you have to think about kind of
that in the context of your problem.

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,690
Now Euclidean distance is easily
generalizable to higher dimensions.

109
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,350
But even if you have, you know, instead
here we

110
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,450
just have two dimension, but if you have
100 dimensions, you

111
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,270
can easily take the difference between
100, each of the dimensions,

112
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,680
square it, sum it together and then take
the square root.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
So it's a very nice type

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,623
kind of, it, it extends very naturally to
very high dimensions problems.

115
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:43,036
[BLANK_AUDIO]

116
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:48,052
The Manhattan distance gets its name from
the idea that, you know, you can, you

117
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:51,730
can look at points on a kind of a grid or
a city block grid.

118
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,120
Think or imagine you're in the city of
Manhattan in New York.

119
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,820
And you want to get from one point to
another.

120
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,120
So you can look at the two black circles
on this diagram.

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,290
And if you want to get from one point to
another,

122
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,870
if you're in a city, you know, in a city

123
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,180
block, you can't just go directly from one
point to

124
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,320
another, because there'd be all these
buildings in the way, or

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,970
you'd have to follow the streets.

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,320
And so in the streets, because they're in
a grid,

127
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,196
you can either go up or down, or left or
right.

128
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:17,560
The green line here in that case would

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,716
represent the Euclidean distance which
would be like if,

130
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,080
you know, if you were a bird, and you

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,095
wanted to fly over everything, across the
two points.

132
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:27,310
But as a person walking on the ground, you
have to take either the red line,

133
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,590
the blue line, or the yellow line, or

134
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,970
any other, kind of, kind of pattern in
between.

135
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,580
The point is that you'd have to travel
along

136
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,620
the city blocks.

137
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,470
And so, the distance that you would travel
along the city blocks here, in the

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,510
gray, kind of, you can imagine the gray

139
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,640
lines as the streets, that's the Manhattan
distance.

140
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,980
And it, it can written formulaically as
the,

141
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,772
as the absolute sum of all the different
coordinates.

142
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:51,166
So if you have two coordinates, you know,
and you

143
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,902
sum the distance that you travel in the X
dimension,

144
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:56,524
and then you sum, and then the distance,
the absolute

145
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:59,160
value of the distance you travel in the Y
direction.

146
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,207
And so the Manhattan distance can be
useful in some contexts, and, and so and,

147
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:05,373
because it more, it may, in some contexts,

148
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:09,236
more accurately represent the distance
between two points.

149
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:12,729
In particular, in a city like Manhattan,
two points may be very far apart.

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,900
Even if they, you know, if they seem
relatively

151
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,320
close, you know, in a, in a Euclidean
distance sense.
