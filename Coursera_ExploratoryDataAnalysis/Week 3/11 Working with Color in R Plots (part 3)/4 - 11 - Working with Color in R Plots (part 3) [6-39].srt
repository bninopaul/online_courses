1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:02,150
So the qu-, you might be wondering, well
where

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,950
do I come up with interesting palettes of
colors?

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,180
Well, you can always create your own
palette

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,670
of col-, colors, just that I did in

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,390
the previous slides, by say, by indicating
colors

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,610
like red, yellow, or anything in the
colors vector.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,300
That you get when you've, when you call
the colors function.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,670
But you might want to come up with some
more interesting colors, color palettes,

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,320
and that can be done using the color brew,
the RColorBrewer package in R.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,030
So the RColorBewer package

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,420
is available on CRAN and all it does is it
provides a

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,320
set of interesting palettes that you can
use for different types of data.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,380
And these are this, this package was
created from

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,330
work that was done by Cynthia Brewer,
who's at Penn

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,470
State and she's done a lot of work
researching

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,090
appropriate colors for, for creating maps
and for mapping data.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,280
So, but these palettes can be quite useful
for

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,030
other types of data that don't really
occur on maps.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,140
So the three types of palettes that you
can cre-, that you can get from

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,906
the color, RColorBrewer package are the
sequential

21
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:02,280
palettes, the diverging palettes and the
qualitative palettes.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,240
So the sequential palettes are used for
data that are ordered.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,434
You can think of this as being used for
numerical data or continuous data.

24
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,330
It doesn't have to be continuous but the
dat-, the

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,500
idea is that the data are ordered from low
to high.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,080
But diverging palettes can be used

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,210
for data that kind of diverge, or they
deviate from something.

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,170
For example, if you have a bunch of data
and

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,480
you want to show the deviations from their
mean then you

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,250
might, so this way, in this sense that
there's data

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,550
that can be positive and there's data that
can be negative.

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,810
And they can, as they go away from

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,430
whatever that center point is, maybe that
center

34
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,300
point is zero, they can get bigger in

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,260
two different directions, maybe going
negative and going positive.

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,330
So that's a diverging

37
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,890
set of data, if you want to use a
diverging color palette to represent that.

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,130
The last color palette is the qualitative
palette which is

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,630
just used to, to represent data that are
not ordered.

40
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,200
So these can be factors or categorical
data that

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,030
don't have any specific ordering, they
just have different values.

42
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,385
So so the palette information that you get
from the, RColorBrewer package

43
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:05,415
can be passed to functions like colorRamp
and colorRampPalette to be used

44
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,210
in the plotting functions in R.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
So these are the various palettes that are
found in the RColorBrewer package.

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,090
The top set here these are the sequential
palettes and you can see that

47
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,160
they basically go from light to dark for
as you go from left to right.

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,392
But they go, they travel through a
different set of colors on each

49
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:28,150
palette so the top one here kind of goes
from yellow, orange to red.

50
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,220
And then the bottom one here is called the
Blues palette.

51
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,540
It just goes, goes by light blue to a dark
blue.

52
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,300
So these are used for ordered data,

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,430
for numerical data that have a low and a
high.

54
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,948
The second set of palettes here, is the,
is the

55
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:43,900
qualitative palettes and these are used to
represent categorical datas.

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,280
And you can use, see that the colors

57
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,610
in the palettes don't really have any
specific ordering.

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,390
They don't go from light to dark.

59
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,620
They don't go, they don't go from any
specific order.

60
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,590
But they do, so they just have a certain
set of colors

61
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,730
associated with them, and they, and each
palette has basically a theme.

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,390
some,

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,340
some palettes are kind of bolder than
others,

64
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,910
and some are more on the pastel side.

65
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,210
The last set of colors, you can see, are
the diverging palettes.

66
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,160
And the colors in this palette, you can
see

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,828
that they are kind of light in the middle.

68
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:17,460
And as you go from left to right they get
darker in different color ranges.

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,510
And so, you can think of that, the

70
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,690
left being negative and the right being
positive.

71
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,100
And so these are the, and that's how they
diverge.

72
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,925
And they try, and

73
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,720
they, again they travel through different
sets of

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,810
colors here, so the top one here goes from

75
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,290
a red as you, from the left all the way to
a kind of purple-blue on the right.

76
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,090
And then the bottom one here goes from
brown on

77
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,670
the left to kind of blue or green on the
right.

78
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,870
So you can choose your palette here,
depending

79
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,754
on what kind of color scheme you prefer.

80
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:47,737
[BLANK_AUDIO]

81
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:51,100
So the ColorBrewer package can be loaded
into lib-, after you

82
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,106
install it using the install.packages

83
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:55,865
function, you can view library
RColorBrewer.

84
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,637
And then the brewer.pal function is really
the only

85
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:02,128
useful function in the package and it
takes two arguments.

86
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:05,420
The first argument is the number of colors
that you want for your palette.

87
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,200
And this is usually small, it'll be, you
know, two, three or four.

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,078
You don't need that many blotches on your
palette for the primary colors.

89
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:12,750
And then the second

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,470
argument is the name of the palette.

91
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,780
And the name of the palette really is not
easy to remember, you just have to look in

92
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,530
the help page for brewer.pal and it will
list

93
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,240
all of the names of the palettes that are
available.

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,840
So, here I'm using a blue-green type of
palette

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,242
and I want three different colors from
that palette.

96
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,550
So now, you can see that the character

97
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,850
vector that it returns has three colors
and

98
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,750
they each have a mix of red, green, and
blue, and if you're fluent in hexidecimal,

99
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,340
you'll know what these values are.

100
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,020
But it's not really important to know
exactly what the, the

101
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,930
colors are, you'll be able to see them on
the screen.

102
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,480
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to

103
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,774
pass this palette of colors into the
colorRampPalette function.

104
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:53,910
and, and it's going to return a function
that I'm going to call pal.

105
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,800
So now, I'm going to create the image of
this volcano using the image function.

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,330
But I'm going to, instead of using the
heat colors or the topo colors palette,

107
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,730
I'm going to use this palette that I got,
from the Brewer, ColorBrewer package.

108
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,970
And so, I'm going to specify that I want
20 different

109
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,360
colors to be in, to be represented in this
image.

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,944
So that the 20 colors are going to come,

111
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,000
they're going to be interpolated from this
blue-green palette.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,210
So the resulting image looks something
like this.

113
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,540
And you can see that as it gets, as it
gets higher, the

114
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,128
ima-, the colors get darker and more green
and at the lower elevations,

115
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,605
the colors are lighter and more blue.

116
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,007
[BLANK_AUDIO]

117
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,437
Another function that uses the ColorBrewer
palettes

118
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,830
is the smoothScatter function which comes
with R.

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,998
And, this function is particularly useful
if you have to

120
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,242
plot a lot of, make a scatter plot of a
lot

121
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:47,344
of different points and you don't want to
just have a

122
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:51,380
bunch of dots on the screen that are
overlapping each other.

123
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,510
So here, I'm plotting 10,000 points.

124
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,490
And if I were to just plot this on the
screen using the

125
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,050
plot function I would get a mess of points
that are kind of overlapping

126
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,918
each other, it's kind of hard to see the
details.

127
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:03,120
So the smoothScatter function, what it
does is

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,280
it creates a histogram, a 2D histogram, of

129
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,760
the points in your plot, and it just

130
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,640
plots the histogram using a certain set of
colors.

131
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,580
The default set of colors that it uses is
the blues colors.

132
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,450
Oh sorry, the blues palette in the
RColorBrewer

133
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,120
package which is a sequential palette and
it

134
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,580
gets kind of darker blue as you get higher
and lighter blue as you get lower.

135
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,210
So, the darker

136
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,240
blue areas of this plot are the high
density.

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,560
So that's where all, most the points are
in the high density region and

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,220
the lighter blue parts of the plot are the
lower density regions of the plot.
