1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,370
This lecture is going to be about plotting
and color in R.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,355
It's kind of an adjunct lecture to the
lectures that we've already

3
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:11,420
had in plotting in both base graphics and
the lattice graphics system.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,610
I just want to talk a little bit about how

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,130
you specify different types of colors
using different palates in R.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,140
You might think that the specification of
color in a plot is maybe kind of a

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,590
secondary decision and in some sense it is

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,544
it's definitely secondary to something
like the data,

9
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:30,080
but of course, but the judicious and
appropriate use of colors, I

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,740
think in plots can help to describe the
relationships that you're trying

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,110
to demonstrate and can help various
dimensions of the data come out

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,540
more effectively than if you just choose
an arbitrary set of colors.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,254
So, there are a couple of things,
functions, and things

14
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:50,685
that I want to cover in this lu, lecture,
but the

15
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,430
basic point that I'm, is that the default
color schemes

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,600
for most of the plots in R, are pretty
bad.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,230
And you don't have to be an expert in

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,120
design or anything to really kind of see
this.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,100
But the kind, the natural color schemes
that you kind of gravitate towards when

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,350
you use the plotting functions are not

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,300
particularly well suited for different
kinds of data.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,950
But there have been a number of
developments

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,960
in R, via packages and also in the core

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,080
R system that can help with the handling
of

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,940
specification of colors and, and various
types of plots.

26
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,460
And so we're going to, I'm going to talk
about one

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,570
of these packages and some of the
functions in this lecture.

28
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,410
So, the basic problem that typically comes
out in most plots.

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,780
This is a pretty standard plot in R that
you might see in a presentation

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,540
or a paper there's some points on the plot
and I'm just plotting random points here.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,040
And you see that

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,020
there are, the points are in three
different colors.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,220
The first is black.

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,090
The open circles are in black.

35
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,590
Then there's a couple of points that are
in

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,060
red and a couple of points that are in
green.

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,560
So why does this happen?

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,810
Because in most plotting functions there
will be a col argument, col.

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,220
When you say col equals one, you get
black.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,280
When you say col equals two, you get red

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,210
and when you say col equals three, you get
green.

42
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,230
And so, if you have a plot and you want
three different

43
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,110
colors in it.

44
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,500
It's very easy to say, okay, well, just
give me col equals one, two, three.

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,345
and, and so, you get black, red, and
green.

46
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,550
Col equals four, would have been something
like

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,920
cyan, and then, col equals five is
magenta.

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,120
So, those are the kind of standard colors
that you just get stuck with,

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,470
when you, when you set col equal to be
one, two, three, four or five.

50
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,200
And so if you go this route the red and
the green don't,

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,070
are not particularly meaningful in this,
in this case.

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,778
Of course, you don't know what the data
are about.

53
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:39,190
So it's it's possible that they are, but
in most cases, they're not the,

54
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,870
the most suitable colors for the type of
data that you're going to show.

55
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,560
And, and also, just from a design point if
you use this color scheme all the time,

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,900
then all of your plots will look like

57
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,228
they belong in some Christmas show or
Christmas presentation.

58
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,340
So, if the question

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,120
is whether or not we can choose a better
set of

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,260
colors that better communicates the idea
that we're trying to get across.

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,700
Another standard set of colors is shown
here.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,330
This is the volcano data set that comes
with R.

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,060
And it's basically a data set that shows
different elevations of a volcano.

64
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,280
And, there two, the color, set of colors
on the

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,580
left is called, is comes from the heat
colors palette.

66
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,380
And so, this is a palette of colors that,
goes from kind

67
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,320
of a reddish to, to indicate low, to a
yellow or white, to indicate high.

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,895
And then, on the right side here, we've
got a

69
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:32,480
palette of colors called the topo colors
or topographical colors

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,800
and this goes from a kind of blue, which
indicates

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,250
low to a a brown or a white which
indicates high.

72
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,260
So for the heat colors it, if you know
what fire is,

73
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,810
it may be reasonable to, to kind of see
that picture

74
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,220
and know that kind of what is low and what
is high.

75
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,160
For the topographical colors, it's not,
maybe not immediately clear

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,790
to some people wha, what is low and what
is high,

77
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,890
it's not so the fact that blue is low and

78
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,750
green is higher than blue it may not be
particularly obvious.

79
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,030
It's not particularly obvious to me.
