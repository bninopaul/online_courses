1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,690
So if you look at, if we break down the

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,340
components of the singular value
decomposition we can take, look at

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,960
the u, the kind of the u and the v

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,000
matrix of the left singular values and the
right singular values.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,760
So you, if you look at the original data
matrix here on

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,790
the left, so that's the image plot here
that, that we saw before.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,760
And then on the, in the middle plot here,
I plot the, the left, the left,

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,170
the first, sorry, the first left singular
vector.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:36,370
And it kind of roughly shows basically the
mean of all the, of that kind of data set.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,510
So if you look, if you plot, if you plot
it across the rows, you can see that the

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,430
first singular vector is kind of, has a
negative value.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,538
For rows 40 through about 18 or so or 17.

13
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:53,770
And then it has a positive value for the
remaining rows.

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:01,220
So that shows the clear separation in the
means of the two sets of of rows, right.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,410
And if you look at the the, the, the

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,140
right sing, the first right singular
vector you can see

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,760
that this also shows the change in the
mean between

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,000
the the first five columns and the second
five columns.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,700
And so the nice thing

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,360
about the singular value decomposition
here is that

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,405
it immediately, it immediately picked up
on the shift

22
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,040
in the means, both kind of in the

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,510
row, from the row dimension and the column
dimension.

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,100
Without you having to tell it anything.

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,490
It was totally unsupervised, and it just
kind of picked it up automatically.

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,740
So remember, we made a plot that was very,
very similar to this before, but that

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,950
was be, when we knew that there was this
kind of pattern in the data set.

28
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,040
So here the, the singular value
decomposition

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,900
picked up the pattern right away.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,090
And, and, and in the first kind

31
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,620
of singular vet, left and right singular
vectors.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
Another kind of component of the singular
value

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,290
decomposition is, is known as the variance
explained.

34
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,300
And this comes from the singular values
that are in the d matrix.

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,160
Remember the d matrix, is really a
diagonal matrix.

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,680
It only has elements that are on the
diagonal of that matrix.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,800
And you can think of each singular value
as representing the percent of

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,390
the total variation in your data

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,340
set that's explained by that particular
component.

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,730
And so, and the components are typically
ordered so that the first one explains

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,180
the most variation as possible, and the

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,600
second one explains the second most, et
cetera.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,180
And so you can plot the kind of proportion
of

44
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,650
variance explained as we have in the in
this plot below.

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,410
And so here on the left hand side I've
just plotted the raw singular values

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,510
and you can see that they kind of decrease
in value as you go across the columns.

47
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,650
But of course the raw singular

48
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,100
value doesn't really have much meaning
cause it's not on an interpretable scale.

49
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,330
So if I divide by the total sum of

50
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,890
all the singular values, then on the right
hand side

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,720
I've got the, I can interpret it as the

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,180
proportion of the variance explained, and
you can see that's

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,350
exactly the same plot but the y axis has

54
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,600
changed, and so you can see that the first
singular

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,330
value if you recall it captures kind of
the shift

56
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,220
and the mean in between the rows and the
columns.

57
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,600
That,

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,580
that captures about 40% of the variation
in your data.

59
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,850
Alright, so almost almost half of the
variation in the

60
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,970
data is explained by a single kind of
singular value.

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,210
Or you can think of it as a single
dimension.

62
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,760
And then, the remaining variation in the
data is explained by the other components.

63
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,700
So, just to show that the relationship
between the

64
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,230
singular value decomposition and the
principle components is close, see,

65
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,900
I, I, here, I plotted, I've calculated the
SVD

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,850
and the, and the PCA of the same data
matrix.

67
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,460
And I've plotted the principle components
on the, X axis, and the

68
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,060
for, sorry, the principle component, first
principle component on the X axis.

69
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,020
And the first right singular val, vector
on the y-axis.

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,120
And you can see that they fall exactly in
a line that

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,800
they're exactly the same things.

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,810
So the svd and the principle components,
and

73
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,430
principle components analysis is
essentially the same thing.

74
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,850
And so if you hear, you know, you're in a
cocktail party and you hear two people

75
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,870
talking about the svd and pca you can

76
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,990
rest assured that they're basically doing
the same thing.

77
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,580
So if we look at, if we look, take a
closer look at the variance explained.

78
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,390
Here we've got a very simple example which
is just basically

79
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,830
a, kind of a matrix that has either zeros
or ones.

80
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,440
And so the idea is that there's basically

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,040
there's only one pattern in this matrix,
right?

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,510
And so the first five columns are zeros.

83
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,970
And the second five columns are wants
that's it, nothing special and so if I

84
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,810
plot the data you can see on the left hand
side that the, left part,

85
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,109
the first five are red with the further
kind of second five are yellowish white.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,030
So now if I take the SVD of this, kind of,

87
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,870
relatively boring matrix, you can see that
I can plot the

88
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,260
singular values and you can see that
there's one singular value

89
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,190
that's very high and the rest are kind of
zero, basically.

90
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,020
And what you'll see is that the first
singular

91
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,760
value explains 100% of the variation in
the data set.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,440
So how can that be?

93
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,390
Well, if you think about this data set,
even though there is, kind of,

94
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,240
40 rows andten columns, there's really
only one dimension to this data set, which

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
is that, if you're in the first five
columns, your mean is, you're equal

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,520
to 0, and if you're in the second five
columns, you're equal to 1.

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,210
So even though you have lots of so-called
observations, there's really only

98
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,440
kind of a small fraction of information
that's actually useful in this matrix.

99
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,740
And so that's captured by the SVD.

100
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,070
By the fact that you can explain 100%

101
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,160
of the variation with a singular, a single
component.

102
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,380
So let's add a second pattern to the data
set.

103
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,780
So we can add a pattern that's kind of
that's

104
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,050
kind of goes across the rows and also goes
across the columns.

105
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,020
And so one pat, the first pattern to be,

106
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,990
going to become a block pattern that we
saw before.

107
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,220
So the first half of this is going to have
one

108
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,960
mean and one half of this is going to have
another mean.

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,840
And the second

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,050
column, the second pattern, basically, is
going to alternate between the columns.

111
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,130
So you can see what that looks like over
here.

112
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,270
So on the left hand side that's the data
and you can see that there's one pattern.

113
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,000
That's kind of like, that's kind of a
block pattern so the

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,180
left five columns are low and the right
five columns are higher.

115
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,420
And then you can see that, within that,
kind of nested within

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,800
that, is a kind of pattern that's kind of
every other column.

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,530
And so, so the, every other column is, one
is higher than the other.

118
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,030
And so if you plot, if we, if you plot the
kind

119
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,480
of, what the truth is, right, we can see
that on the,

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,560
in the middle plot here, the first five
columns have a have

121
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,730
a lower mean, and the second five columns
have a higher mean.

122
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,200
And that's the first pattern, and then the
second pattern shows that the first column

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,790
has a mean of 0, the second column has a
mean of 1.

124
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,622
The third column as

125
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:45,580
a mean of 0 and the fourth column et
cetera.

126
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,820
So there's, there's two patterns here.

127
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,960
One is a shift pattern and the second is

128
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,170
this kind of alternating pattern, so
that's the truth.

129
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,640
But of course, we rarely know the truth,
so

130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,430
we need to learn the truth from the data.

131
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,380
So if you, the idea is if you were
presented

132
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
with the data set that we've shown here on
the left.

133
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,370
Can you come up with an algorithm that can
pick up

134
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,330
on the two separate patterns that are
buried within the data?

135
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,700
And so that's

136
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,900
kind of what the SVD is for.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,390
So if we run the SVD on this new matrix
with the two patterns.

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,610
I got the data here on the left and the
middle pan,

139
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,730
the middle panel here, I've got the first,
the first right singular vector.

140
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,250
And you can see it roughly picks up the
block pattern.

141
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,510
Right?

142
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,970
So the first, kind of, five are, are

143
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,180
somewhat lower, and the second five are
somewhat higher.

144
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,880
Right?
So it's not as pretty as the truth was.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,870
But it's somewhat discernible, that there
are two different kind of means here.

146
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,020
The second sorry, the second right
singular

147
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,950
vector is on the right-hand panel here.

148
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,270
And you can see that, it's a little bit
harder to see,

149
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,540
but it does try to pick up the alternating
mean pattern, right?

150
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,400
It's not as obvious as it was when we were
plotting the truth, of course.

151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,600
But you can see that every other point is
either higher or lower.

152
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,110
Now of course since we know what the truth
is

153
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,960
it's a little bit easier to, kind of, talk
about this.

154
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,530
But but in general you can see that the
two patterns are roughly confounded

155
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,950
with each other because it's a little bit
hard to set the two patterns apart.

156
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,190
So even though they're clearly in the, we

157
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,490
know that the truth is, is, is two
separate

158
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,240
patterns, the, the first and the second
right

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,420
singular vectors are also known as the
principle components.

160
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,450
They kind of mix the two patterns
together,

161
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,690
so each of them has a block pattern.

162
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,560
And each of them has a kind of alternating
pattern.

163
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,330
And so unfortunately, just, just like with
most real data, the truth is a

164
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,130
little, is a little bit hard to discern
than if you'd known it in advance.

165
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Now if you look at the variance explained
in this problem

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,740
you can see that on the right-hand panel
which is the

167
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,815
percent of the variance explained, that
the first component explains over

168
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:54,870
50% of the variation, the total variation
in the data set.

169
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,580
And that's basically because the shift
pattern you know, with

170
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,600
the first five columns, the second five
columns is so strong.

171
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,830
It represents a large amount of variation
in the data set.

172
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,340
So you capture that shift

173
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,070
pattern, you kind of capture a lot of that
variation.

174
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,790
You see the second component only captures
about 18 or so

175
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,380
percent of the variation and it kind of
trails off from there.

176
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,240
And so that's going to tell, that kind of
tells you roughly,

177
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,990
you know, how many components are in this
data set.

178
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,780
But that alternating pattern which kind
of, which is kind of every other

179
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,030
column is a little bit harder to pick up,
as you can see.
