1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,300
So the grDevices package has a few
different

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,540
functions to help, you deal with colors
and the

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,930
ones that I'm going to talk about in this

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,450
lecture are the colorRamp function and the
colorRampPalette function.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,715
basically, these two functions do take

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,060
palettes of colors and interpolate between
them.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,640
So the, the, the model that you could
think of is basically, you know,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,990
if a painter has, his palette, and there
are of four, two or three

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,660
blotches of specific colors on that
palette.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,760
And then what you might do is take your
brush,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,740
and kind of mix between the various colors
of the various

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,090
per, blotches on that palette, to create
new colors that are

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,620
blends of the original colors that you had
on the palette.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,940
So I've never done any actually painting,
so

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,650
I just the only thing I know about
painting

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,090
is you know from TV and movies but, that's
kind of what I imagine a painter would do

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,655
is take these primary colors and then
blend them together with the brush.

18
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,650
And so, that's what the colorRamp and the
colorRampPalette functions

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,770
do, they take a set of colors that make up

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,370
a palette and they interpolate between
them numerically of course

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,010
to make new colors that are blends of the
original colors.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,470
Another function that may be of interest
to you is the

23
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,090
colors function which just, you just
executed with no arguments and it

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,170
gives you a character vector of all the
names of

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,590
the colors that you can use in a plotting
function.

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,550
So these are colors that you can reference
by name rather than having to

27
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,700
reference their kind of red, green, and
blue values that we'll talk about later.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,350
So the colorRamp function specifically
takes a

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,090
palette of colors and it returns another
function.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,290
And this, this function that's returned by
colorRamp will take values

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,960
between 1 and 1 indicating the extremes of
the color palette.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,090
And so, a similar function that already
exists in R is the gray function.

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,350
And the gray function interpolates between
black and white.

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,500
And so it gives you kind of all

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,604
the shades of gray there between black and
white.

36
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:04,366
The colorRamp function is a generalization
because it will take any

37
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:07,006
set of colors in your palette and it will
give you

38
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,042
a function back that takes numbers between
0 and 1 and

39
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:14,183
it kind of interpolate between the
extremes of the color palette.

40
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:18,473
The colorRampPalette is a very similar
type of function it takes a palette

41
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,698
of colors and what it does it returns
another function that rather than taking

42
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,492
a value between 0 and 1.

43
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,848
It would takes an integer argument and it

44
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,080
will return a vector of colors
interpolating that palette.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,255
So, this is similar to the heat.colors
function or the topo.colors function.

46
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,290
So, So let's just.

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,200
A very quick example here.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,670
In the top here, I've created I'm going to
use

49
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,090
a palette that consists of two colors, red
and blue.

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,160
So you can imagine that on your

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,740
little painter's palette here, you've got
a blotch

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,300
of red and a blotch of blue, and you're
going to

53
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,560
mix them together in varying degrees to
create new colors.

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,160
So I, when I pass this through colorRamp
it returns function back and

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,540
that function I've called pal, and, and
now pal can take numbers between 0 and 1.

56
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,780
So when I say pal (0).

57
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,510
What do I get back?

58
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,120
I get a little matrix here with one row
and three columns.

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,980
And the three columns

60
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,750
indicate, are, are, represent the colors
red, blue and green.

61
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,800
And so in the first column, I've got 255
which is the

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,380
maximum value that I can have in this, for
the, for these colors.

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,440
The numbers that you specify go between 0
and 255, so

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,250
there's 256 total numbers that you can
specify for each color.

65
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,445
And so when pal is when I, when pal

66
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:38,070
(0), it gives the argument 0, basically
what it gives

67
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,400
me back is red, because that's kind of one
end

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,510
of the color spectrum that I've specified
in my palette.

69
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,310
The other end being blue, of course.

70
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,180
And so I've got the maximum value for red,
I've

71
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,050
got 0 for green, and I've got 0 for blue.

72
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,998
So that color is red.

73
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,348
When I say pal (0) down here you see, I've
got 0 for

74
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:59,370
red, 0 for green, and then I've got the
maximum 255 for blue.

75
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,740
So this just gives me the color blue.

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,860
So that's the other end of my color
palette.

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,990
So what if I do something in between, like
pal (0.5)?

78
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,105
So this gives me something that, this
should give me a

79
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:11,192
color that's kind of in the middle of red
and blue.

80
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:18,242
So it's going to give me 127.5 for red,
and then 0 for green, then 127.5 for blue.

81
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:22,777
So it's kind of half red, half blue,
whatever that color is happens to be.

82
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:25,182
Notice that there's no green in any of
these

83
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,822
calls because when in interpolate between
red and blue,

84
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,200
you don't encounter green along the way.

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,544
So if I were to give a sequence of numbers
between 0 and

86
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:44,070
1s pal would give me a sequence of colors
between red and blue.

87
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,700
So here I'm giving a sequence between 0
and 1 that's that's, that's a length 10.

88
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,980
So it starts at 0 and it ends at 1 and and
there's a eight numbers in between.

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,070
And so when I pass the sequence to pal,
you'll see at the very top here, I've

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,850
got, I start with red, so it's maximum
red, and then, 0 for green, 0 for blue.

91
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:01,980
And

92
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,960
I slowly reduce the red amount and
increase the blue amount, till I get

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,240
to the bottom here, where I've got all
blue and no green and no red.

94
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,510
So those are the various colors that you
get

95
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,940
in between red and blue as you interpolate
the palette.

96
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,492
So, that's the colorRamp function.

97
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,780
The colorRamp palette function is very
similar but it just

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,530
it, the type of function that it returns
is slightly different.

99
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,180
So here I'm passing it a different
palette.

100
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,010
So this palette has two blotches, it has a
red and a yellow

101
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,730
blotch on it and we're going to try and
interpolate between those two colors.

102
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,202
And so I've got a function here that's
returned by colorRampPalette

103
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:43,150
called pal and now pal is going to take
integer arguments not

104
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,890
numbers between 0 and 1.

105
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,961
So, suppose I give it 2, so pal

106
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:52,380
(2) will return two colors that
interpolate the palette.

107
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,060
Now, because the palette itself only has
two colors

108
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,880
they will, when I just give a 2 it'll

109
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
just give me the two colors on the palette

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,160
so the first being red and the second
being yellow.

111
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,130
And so, that the way that the format here
is slightly

112
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,000
different instead of giving a matrix with
red, green, and blue values.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,370
It gives me a character vector

114
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,660
which has numbers for, or, or values for

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,820
red, green, and blue that are represented
in hexadecimal.

116
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,076
And so if you ignore the pound symbol
there, you'll see there are two digits.

117
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,460
There are six digits in, in each character
string.

118
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,360
The first two represent red, the second
two

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,340
represent green, and the third two
represent blue.

120
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,730
So you can see for the first number here
I've got FF0000.

121
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,700
So in hexadecimal

122
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,900
F is the largest number you can have.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,960
So FF on the red, the red pair means a

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,130
maximum for red is 00 for green 00 for
blue.

125
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,360
So that's red.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,150
In the second string here, I've got FF for
red, FF for green and then 00 for blue.

127
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,730
So I've got the maximum on red and maximum
on green and I got nothing for blue.

128
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,770
So what does that gives me?

129
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,870
Well, that gives me yellow and by
combining red and green I get yellow.

130
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,100
So that's the other end of the spectrum on
the palette.

131
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,040
So, when now, if I say pal (10), you'll
see the first element here

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,700
is going to be red, because it's FF on red
and 0 on everything else.

133
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,170
The last element here is going to be
yellow, because it's

134
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,070
FF on red, FF on green, 0 on the blue.

135
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,720
But then in between, I've got my
interpolation of colors, so you'll see

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,920
that there's, there'll be there'll be,
there'll be some red, and then there'll

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,860
be some mix ins, a little bit of green as
you go along here.

138
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,860
For more, for all the colors there's no
blue, because there's,

139
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,110
you don't encounter blue when you
interpolate between red and yellow.

140
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,690
So you can see now the representations of
the colors

141
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,654
in hexadecimal here changing as you go
from red to yellow.

142
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:38,724
