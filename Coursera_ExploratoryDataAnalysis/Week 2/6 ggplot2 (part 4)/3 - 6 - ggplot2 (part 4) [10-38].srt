1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,190
Now, another layer that you can add to
your plot is a smoother,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,930
and many times you want to do this just so
you can get a sense

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,740
of the overall trend in the data, so I
want to, you might want to get

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,150
a general sense of, as PM 2.5 increases do
we get more nocturnal symptoms?

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,530
So on the left hand side here, these, this
is this is the code down here.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,180
The bottom that I use, I have my original
GG plot

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,260
object, G which just had the X and Y kind
of Aesthetics.

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,630
I added my points to make the scatter plot

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,870
and I added a smooth a geom underscore
smooth function.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,230
It adds a little smoother which is the
blue line and the grey confidence bands

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,120
and so I used the default for the geom
smooth which is a low s smoother.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,650
And which is generally fine.

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,720
But you can see there's a lot of noise on
the boundaries, so on

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,420
the left and right side of the smoother
the confidence intervals get very wide

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,440
because it's flexible smoother, and the
noise, there's a lot

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,950
of noise on the boundaries because there's
not much data there.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,430
And so I'd rather something a little bit
simpler

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,580
than [INAUDIBLE] I just want a linear
regression line.

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,680
And, and so, that's less flexible, but it
still gives me a sense of the trend.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,330
So, here on the, on the right hand side,
you see

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,490
I've re-, I've re-made the plot, and I've
added the geome smooth,

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,010
but I give it, in option, I said method
equals LM, and

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,700
this will do a linear model instead of a
low S smoother.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,480
And you can

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,030
see that on the edges of the linear model,
the, the uncertainty

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,320
in the compass band's a lot smaller than
it is for low S.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,180
And you see that generally speaking there
seems to

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,340
be an increasing trend with pm 2.5 and
nocturnal symptoms.

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,980
So, another layer we want to add is the
facet.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
So, this is the final layer to kind of
reproduce that original simple plot.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,370
That I made with Q Plot.

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,040
So here the facets are going to be,

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,560
are going to be determined by the BMI
category.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,900
So I want to compare children who are

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,410
normal weight and children who are
overweight.

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,790
And so that's going to be two separate
plots, but then I

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,430
want to plot the same relationship in each
one of those windows.

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,900
So that's what creates the facet.
And so, I can add my facet

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,560
with the the facet underscore grid
variable.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,220
And this variable uses special notation
which is separate.

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,295
Which has kind of a variable on the

42
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,490
left-hand side and a variable on the
right-hand side.

43
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,610
And, and they're separated by this tilde.

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,720
And so, the variables that you specified
in the

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,250
facet function determine how the grid, how
the separate plots.

46
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,820
Are laid out on the screen.

47
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,920
And so, the number of plots will be,

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,770
will be equal to the number of levels of
your factor.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,910
And so, I have two levels in my factor.

50
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,580
I've got normal weight and overweight.

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,910
Then that will create two plots for me.

52
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,350
If I, notice I only have a single Set

53
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,700
a factor variable that I want to separate
on.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,690
So, I don't want, I'm not going to have a
matrix of plots.

55
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm just going to have a single row of
plots.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,070
And so, I'll, if I, so I'm only going to

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,020
have two plots because there's two
categories in this BMI variable.

58
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,090
If

59
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,780
I had two variables, which I, and I'll
give you an example of that later.

60
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,300
So a variable on the left-hand side and
the

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,900
variable on the right-hand side, the in
the product

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,600
of the number of factor levels is going to
be

63
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,560
the number of plots that you generate with
the facets.

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,340
So here I've added the facet grid function
and I also added the smoother with my lm.

65
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,270
Notice that it doesn't, it doesn't really
matter

66
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,190
what kind of order you put these things
in.

67
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,230
You can add them in Any order

68
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,610
you want.

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,090
And notice I stuck the facet grid function
in between the smooth

70
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,080
and the point and that was fine it still
generated the plot.

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,910
So facets are useful for, for kind of
conditioning on a categorical variable.

72
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,900
And you can see it here that the normal
weight children have

73
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,960
don't seem to have any relationship in pm
2.5 and nocturnal symptoms.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,300
Whereas the overweight children might
appear

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,580
to have a stringer more positive
relationship.

76
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,490
The last thing that I'll mention is you
notice

77
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,820
the labels in each of the panels I didn't,

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,910
I didn't actually label them by hand, the
labels

79
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,480
come from the levels the factor variable
that you condition

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,330
So it's important that you use the factor
variables

81
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,090
in an intelligent way and have intelligent
labels on

82
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,690
them because the GEGE plot will take that
information

83
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,920
and automatically apply it to the labeling
of your plots.

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,170
And so in GEGE plot the substance is
easier to

85
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,540
modify your data and make sure

86
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,680
the metadata is then specified
appropriately rather

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,770
than to kind of Plot things and then kind
of modify the plot later.

88
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,020
It's better to make sure all your data is
kind of organized and labeled

89
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,650
appropriately before you make the plot,
because

90
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,970
then that makes the plotting code much
simpler.

91
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,120
Okay, so once you've kind of made your
plot often you want to modify things

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,880
like the axis labels and the titles and,
and other kinds of kind of plot metadata.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,380
And so there are a number of, of functions
for doing that.

94
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,750
For, for the labels there's the xlab

95
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,690
function, the ylab function and the
ggtitle function.

96
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,090
Those are all st-, I use to specify the x
label, the y label and the title.

97
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,280
You could also use the labs function,
which is a

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,540
more general function that can be used to
specify x,

99
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,440
y labels or titles.
It doesn't really matter what you use.

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,520
Each of the geom functions, like the geom
points and the geom,

101
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,060
smooth function have options that you can
use to change things, so you

102
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,790
can explore some of those options too if
you don't like the default.

103
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,040
There are some things that only make

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,390
sense kind of at a global thing, globally
meaning

105
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,110
for the whole plot, and so that the theme
function is vail, is available for that.

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,790
So this might specify kind of the big
basic colors, the background

107
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,030
colors are here for example the le, the
position of the legend.

108
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,300
And you can use the theme

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,290
function to specify these options.

110
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,600
Then finally there are, there are some
general themes that are built

111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,180
in that kind of control a lot of different
elements of the plot.

112
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,590
So you can specify to kind of set many
options at

113
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,790
once and, and basically The theme_gray is
kind of the default theme.

114
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,280
It gives you the gray background with the
white line, the white grid lines.

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,490
The theme_bw for black and white is a kind

116
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,300
of more stark, a plainer theme if you
don't

117
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,940
like the gray background.

118
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,730
So, I'll talk a little bit about kind

119
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,010
of modifying some of the features of the
aesthetics.

120
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,160
So for example, sometimes there, you might
want to change the colors of the points

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,720
if you don't like black points or if you
don't like them to be solid.

122
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,330
You like them to be transparent.

123
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,500
You can, on the left-hand side, I've
modified, modified my, my

124
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,700
basic scatter plot of pm2.5 and nocturnal
symptoms by doing two things.

125
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,850
One is I've made the color steel blue.

126
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,070
I've increased the size of the points to
be 4 the default is 1.

127
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,600
And I've, and I've changed the alpha

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,590
transparency to be a half rather than
solid.

129
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,970
So now you can see that the blue, there's
blue points that are a

130
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,330
steel blue, they're somewhat transparent
and they're

131
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,140
a lot bigger than they were before.

132
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,760
The important thing to realize that I,

133
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,420
I've placed these options in the geo-point
function

134
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,030
and each one of these options the color,
the size, the alpha, have all been

135
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,940
set to be a constant.

136
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,980
And so the constants Basically are, are
for the are not actually

137
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,290
aesthetics they're just options for the,
for putting the points on the page.

138
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,690
On the right hand side here you can see

139
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,210
that the plot looks similar but I I've,
I've got,

140
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,280
there's two colors now and each of the
colors corresponds

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,640
to if the child is over weight or normal
weight.

142
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,530
And so now you can see what I call, what
is called geom_point.

143
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,770
Rather than say just color equals bmicat,
which would assign

144
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,070
the, the category of bmi to be a different
color.

145
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,610
I had to wrap it in this aes function
which stands for aesthetics.

146
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,850
So now, rather than specify color as a
constant like

147
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,100
steel blue The color has been assigned to
a data variable.

148
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,020
And so, it's very important that you know
the distinction between, giving

149
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,610
a, assigning a color to be a constant,
like black or white or

150
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,490
blue, and assigning color to be the value
of a variable.

151
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,670
So, when you assign color to be the value
of a variable - What happens

152
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,490
is that all the points and each set of
points is assigned a different color.

153
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,390
Then they are put back on the page along
with this legend on the right hand side.

154
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,010
Then outside of the A.E.S. function I
still have

155
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,580
my size equals 4 and my alpha equals 1/2.

156
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,540
So those are unchanged from the left hand
plot.

157
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,930
So that the points are still bigger, and
the transparency is still half.

158
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,750
And so, so the import-, so, so the key to

159
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,010
remember here is that there's a difference
between assigning a

160
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,010
aesthetic value to be a constant, and
assigning aesthetic to

161
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,830
be, to be the, the correspondent, or
variable, data variable.

162
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,000
If you want it to be a constant, you

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,010
can just specify in the geom point
function directly.

164
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,520
If you want it to be assigned to a data

165
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,140
variable, then you have to wrap it in this
aes function.

166
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,230
You can modify the labels with the labs
function.

167
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,200
So the labs function here I've called a
few different times.

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,910
I've added on to my basic plot.

169
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,990
So the g object, remember, it's just the
data frame plus the x and y coordinates.

170
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,000
Here I've added geome point function, and

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,060
I've, I've signed the color variable, the
BMI

172
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,140
category, so now the different, the two

173
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,240
different BMI categories in, in two
different colors.

174
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,540
The labels I set the title to be

175
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,370
max cohort, because that's where the data
come from.

176
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,080
This is a max study.

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,410
I've set the x label to be this
expression,

178
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,890
which is log of pm 2.5, and I used the

179
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,050
mathematical annotation that I talked,
that we talked about previously

180
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,190
to get that pm 2.5 that 2.5 subscript on
there.

181
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,900
And then I took the y label to just be
nocturnal signal.

182
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,780
So now it's a little bit cleaner.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,860
The plot has kind of more appropriate
labels on it.

184
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,100
I can also customize the smoother if I
want to.

185
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,530
So now, I'm going to modify the options to
the geom's smooth function.

186
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,670
So here all I've done to, is I add an
option to say it's size equals four.

187
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,480
So I made this line a little bit thicker.

188
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,940
And I mad the, the line type to be equal
three.

189
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,470
So the three that, that just means a
dotted line instead of a solid line.

190
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,010
I still use method equals LM, so I want to
regression line.

191
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,000
And I turned off the confidence intervals,

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,130
so I, so that it's a little bit more clear
to see.

193
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,770
So I see SC equals false.

194
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,420
So these are all functions that you can
add to

195
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,769
the GM Smooth function if you don't like
the defaults.

196
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,970
So another thing you can do is just change
the overall theme.

197
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,720
So the default theme, you look in the
previous slide here.

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
You can see that there's a gray

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,330
background, with those kind of white grid
lines.

200
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,280
There's this solid kind of thicker white

201
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,780
lines for kind of larger kind of
intervals.

202
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,780
And then there's kind of thinner white
lines for smaller intervals.

203
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,600
If you don't like that background, you can
change it

204
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,310
to the kind of a more basic black and
white background.

205
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,390
So this is the theme_bw theme.

206
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,080
And another thing, as you can see, I've
changed here is, I've changed

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,940
the font.

208
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,060
So the default font is going to be
something like

209
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,820
Helvetica, but I've changed it to be a
Times font.

210
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,090
So now you can see that it's a serif font
as opposed to sans serif.

211
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,560
And it looks like, and it uses the Times
font to

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,670
do the labels, to do the legend, and also
the axis ticks.

213
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,680
So you can see, the numbers on the axis
are all in the Times font.

214
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
So the theme function, the various theme
functions can

215
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,750
be used to modify these elements of the
plot.
