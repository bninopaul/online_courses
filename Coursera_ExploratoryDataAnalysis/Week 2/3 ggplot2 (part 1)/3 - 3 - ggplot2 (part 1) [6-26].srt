00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:05,278
Hi, everyone, this lesson is going to be
about ggplot2 or the ggplot2 package.

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,729
And we're going to, I'm going to talk
about how to

3
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:11,920
do some basic plots using the ggplot2
package and what it's about.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,168
And in this, in the next lecture I'll talk
a little bit in more detail

5
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:16,848
about how it's designed and how you

6
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:20,740
can make extensions to various ggplot2
plotting functions.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,760
So the first question very basic.
You know, what is ggplot2?

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,850
Basically it's a package

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,250
in R that you can download from CRAN.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,606
And and it implements what's called the

11
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:33,396
grammar of graphics, which is originally
written by

12
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:39,030
Leland Wilkinson and it is described in a,
in a book called the Grammar of Graphics.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,100
Now the Grammar of Graphics is a
description of how

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,090
kind of graphics can be broken down into
abstract concepts.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,160
You can, so think of the grammar of a
language like English.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,360
You have things like verbs and nouns and
adjectives.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,910
And so

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,300
the question is, you know, what are the

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,070
verbs, nouns, and adjectives of a data
graphic?

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,350
And the Grammar of Graphics kind of
describes kind of those basic elements

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,560
so that you can put them together to make
new types of graphics.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,790
Just like you could take a verb and a noun
and an

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,170
adjective and make a new sentence that
maybe no one's ever heard before.

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,810
You could take the grammar of graphics and
put together various aspects

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,330
of plots and make a graphic that no one's
ever seen before and

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,315
so that's the basic idea.

27
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:23,890
It's a very powerful concept to kind of
organize all kinds of data graphics.

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,756
And until recently there was no specific
implementation for it

29
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,020
in R, but Hadley Wickham who when he was a
graduate

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,180
student at Iowa State implement the
Grammar of Graphics as an

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,690
R package called ggplot and its current
implementation is called ggplot2.

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,590
So one could think of this as almost

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,430
a third graphic system in R.

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,170
Even though it's based, is built upon the

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,080
grid graphic system which is, which comes
with R.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,270
It's kind of a third mode of, of plotting
that has become very popular.

37
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,690
So if you think of the first mode as like

38
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,145
the base plots using functions like plot,
and hist, and

39
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:01,080
boxplot, and then the second mode as the
lattice plots

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,960
so using XY plot and these kinds of
trellis type functions.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
And then the third mode is ggplot.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,467
So you get the package from CRAN.
You can, you can use install.packages.

43
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:14,140
It installs on all almost all sys...I
imagine on all systems.

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,054
You can go to the ggplot website which is
ggplot2.org.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,490
And so the nice thing about ggplot is
that, is that, is that it is based

46
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,180
on this grammar of graphics, and so, it,

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,370
in a sense, there's a theory of the
graphics.

48
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,730
So you can take this theory and kind of

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,090
reassemble the different pieces to make
new types of plots.

50
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,150
And as Hadley Whitcomb says in his book,
you know, the basic idea

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,860
is that you want to shorten the distance
from the mind to the page.

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,090
So if you have some data that you're
looking at, And you want,

53
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,680
and you thin of a way that you want to
visualize that data.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,750
You want to be able to rapidly take those

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,560
ideas and turn them into a picture on your
screen.

56
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,360
So, from the GG plot two book,

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,430
this sentence kind of summarizes the basic
idea.

58
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,120
But the idea is that, the grammar tells us

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,030
the statistical graphic is mapping from
data to aesthetic attributes.

60
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,495
So color, shape and size.

61
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:11,050
- of geometric objects, so, points, lines,
and bars, and the plot may also

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,350
contain statistical transformations of the
data and

63
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,750
is drawn on a specific coordinate system.

64
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,010
So, we have things are that, we have a

65
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,720
mapping from data to aesthetics, geometric
objects, we have statistics.

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,860
Now we have a coordinate system.

67
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,160
So in this lecture I just want to talk
about

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,700
the qplot function which is kind of the
most basic

69
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,320
function and it's probably the best place
to start for

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,380
someone who is transitioning from say the
base plotting system.

71
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,780
So in the base plotting system you know
the work horse function

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,070
is the plot function and so qplot which
you can think of as

73
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,770
standing for quick plot Is kind the work
horse function for for

74
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,510
GD plot and its analogous to the plot
function and the base system.

75
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,830
So one

76
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,880
key difference that you have to get used
to when you're using

77
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,660
GD plot is that typically when you make a
plot and you pass

78
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,290
data to the q plot function you want to
tell it where the

79
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,190
data comes from and the data will always
come from a data frame.

80
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,120
So a data frame is going to be.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,990
So, your data have to be organized in a
data frame.

82
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,710
And then when you plot variables those

83
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,710
variables are going to come from the data
frame.

84
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,640
Now, you don't have to specify a data
frame.

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,230
You can

86
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,700
if you don't specify a data frame the the
cue plot function or

87
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,320
all the plotting functions will, will look
for the data in your workspace.

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,610
But it's generally a good idea to specify
the data frame.

89
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,810
That way when you read the code that
generated

90
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,320
the plot You know exactly where the data
came from.

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,180
So then so the data frame is

92
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,430
very important to organize before you
start plotting.

93
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,080
Once you start plotting the plots are made
up of aesthetics

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,490
and geoms and so aesthetics are things
like the size, shape,

95
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,140
and color of things.

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,870
Points and the geoms are sort of

97
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,710
the objects that you're pointing, plotting
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,550
So are you plotting points Are you
plotting

99
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,540
lines, are you plotting bars, you know,
whatnot.

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,120
One aspect that's important for the qplot
function, and also is similarly

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,250
important when you're using lattice
functions,

102
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,390
is the idea of using factor variables.

103
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,160
So factors are very important because they
indicate subsets of your data.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,370
So if you imagine you have a data frame or
you have a y variable and a x

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,080
variable and then a factor variable the
factor will

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,250
indicate subsets of your data in the data
frame.

107
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,340
So for example you might have factor that
indicates the gender.

108
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,050
So you have a bunch of

109
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,180
males and a bunch of females.

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,400
So those are subsets of your data and you

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,660
might want to plot a certain relationship
divided by

112
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,840
the various subsets or you might want to
color

113
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,400
certain points, depending on whether
they're male of female.

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,020
And so the categories that are indicated
by various

115
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,610
factor variables can be useful for
annotating a plot.

116
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,640
And so, one aspect, so one thing that's

117
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,050
important about this feature is that, is
that when

118
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,680
you have factor variables in a data set,

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,440
you want to make sure that they're
properly labeled.

120
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,320
So it's usually not useful to label a
factor variable

121
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,810
as one, two, and three, even if you have
three categories.

122
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,890
One, two, and three is not particularly
informative.

123
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,025
Usually you want to label them with the
more informative labels

124
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,120
so that you know what those factor
variables are trying to encode.

125
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,290
Now the qplot function is a fairly
straight forward function

126
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,330
to use.
I think it's very easy to pick up.

127
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,640
It hides a lot of the details of, of what

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,900
ggplot is doing underneath which is fine
for many cases.

129
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,360
But the ggplot function is really kind of
the core function of the system.

130
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,310
It's very flexible and you can use it in
combination

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,190
with a lot of things that g, that qplot
can't do.
