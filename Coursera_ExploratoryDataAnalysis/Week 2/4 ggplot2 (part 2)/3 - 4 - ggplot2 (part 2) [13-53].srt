1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,780
So, I'm going to start with a little
example data set here.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,440
This data set comes with the GGplot two
package.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,790
You can always just load it up after you
install the packages.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,140
After you install the packages, this is
the mpg data set.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,530
It looks at miles per gallon for a variety
of different types of cars.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,630
You can see in this data set from the stir
that I did that there's 234 observations.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,299
There's 234 different types of cars and
there are 11 variables that are measured.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,220
In particular, I'm going to be looking at
the displacement variable,

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,440
which is an an indicator of how large the
engine is.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,010
So this is the displ variable.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,460
We're going to be looking at the number of
cylinders

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,580
and the sorry, it's the, and the, sorry,
we're going to

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,760
look at the the highway mileage so the hwy

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,880
variable and then we're going to look at
the drv variable.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,540
Which is the whether, what kind of drive
is it a

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,660
four wheel drive, a front wheel drive, or
a rear wheel drive.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,040
So notice how the factors here are labeled
appropriately.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,390
So the, for example, the manufacturer
variable is labeled

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,620
by the manufacturer of the car, Audi,
Chevrolet, etc.

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,590
And then the, the drv variable, which
indicates the type, the drive, is

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,360
indicated with a four for four-wheel
drive,

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,424
f for front-wheel, and r for rear-wheel.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,940
So a very simple plot you can make I call
this

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,948
the hello world for GGplot is the call to
q plot function.

25
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,440
On the x-axis I had this displacement
variable which is a kind

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,410
of engine size variable and on the y-axis
I got the highway mileage.

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,210
You can see that I specify the data frame
with the data arguments.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,330
So I say data equals mpg so that the data
comes from this mpg data frame.

29
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,560
And so that's very simple.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,080
You can see that the plot that it makes

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,760
is, is looks very different from the
traditional base plot.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,170
You can see that it's kind of a

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,760
gray background and there's white grid
lines behind it.

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,430
The points are closed solid circles,
rather than the kind

35
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,680
of more typical open circles from the base
plotting system.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,010
And then their labels on the x and y axis.

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,170
One of the things we can do is modify some
of the, the aesthetics.

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,830
So we can highlight different subgroups of
the data so

39
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,980
one of the subgroups can be determined by
you know.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,380
So there's lots of different cars here,
some of them are front wheel drive,

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,140
some of them are rear wheel drive and some
of them were four wheel drives.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,215
So, we can separate those observations out
by

43
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,570
con-, by looking at the DRV, the drive
variable.

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,570
And so I've I've specified the x and y
coordinates, just like before.

45
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,580
I specified the data frame, just like
before.

46
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,610
And I, and then, another argument I have
is the color variable.

47
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,780
And I'm going to say that the color is
mapped to this drive variable DRV.

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,810
And the, all that says is that the

49
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,760
different levels of the drive variable
will be each

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,710
assigned a different color and notice I
don't

51
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,580
specify what those colors are they are
specified automatically.

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,035
So you can see on this new plot here that
the the

53
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:47,440
front-wheel drive cars are in green, the
rear-wheel drive cars are in blue,

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,220
and the four-wheel drive cars are in red.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,285
And so you can see that most, the

56
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,545
front-wheel drives tend to have the
highest mileage, the

57
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,320
four-wheel drive tends to have the lowest
mileage

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,920
and the rear-wheel drive is something in
the middle.

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,140
And I noticed that the legend was placed
on the plot

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,260
automatically, and the color coding, the
different levels of the factor variable.

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,910
I didn't have to do anything special.

62
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,460
And so its very nicely, kind of, organized
and thought out, and you

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,700
don't have to do anything.
Everything's done automatically.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,020
Another thing that you sometimes want to
add is a statistic,

65
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,070
so a statistic is just some summary of the
data.

66
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,450
And so the summary that we've chosen to
add here is a

67
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,150
kind of smoother or the more technical
name is called low S.

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,690
And and it smooths the data so you can see
the kind of overall trend in the data set.

69
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,670
And you can see that I do this by adding
the geom argument and and

70
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,530
the geom's that I want to put on this plot
are those there's two types.

71
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,010
One is I want to add the plot the

72
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,690
points themselves so I can see the data.

73
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,630
And then I want to add this smooth geom
and the smooth is this blue line that goes

74
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,120
across and the con 95% confidence
intervals for the

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,340
line are indicated by the gray kind of
zone.

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,072
A hit, you can make a histogram with

77
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,480
the qplot function, by only specifying the
single variables.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,390
So here I only specify the highway
variable.

79
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,240
And it shows me the highway mileage for
all the cars in the data set.

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,570
But I get, again I like to kind of

81
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,030
speci, separate out which, which cars are
four wheels drives.

82
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,730
Which cars are front wheel drive,
etcetera.

83
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,070
So again, I specify, instead of a color
argument, I specify the fill argument.

84
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,240
Which says that the different hist
elements

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,150
of the histogram are going to be filled
with

86
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,470
different colors based on what drive they
are.

87
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,234
So here, you can see a similar picture
that

88
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,047
you saw before, which is that the four
wheel

89
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:35,497
drive vehicles tended to have the lowest
mileage, and

90
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,050
the front wheel drive tended to have the
highest mileage.

91
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,061
[BLANK_AUDIO]

92
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,830
Another feature of GGplot are, is called

93
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,700
facets and facets are like panels in
lattice.

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,230
The idea is that you can, you can create
separate plots

95
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,560
which indicate again subsets of your data,
indicated by a factor variable.

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,230
And you can make a panel of plots to look
at separate subsets

97
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,410
together rather, so one option would be to
say, to color code the subsets.

98
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,670
According to different colors like we did
before.

99
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,070
But if that, if you have a lot of data
points, that can be tricky to

100
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,050
look at and then all the colors might
overlap.

101
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,310
And it may be difficult to see the
separate groups.

102
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,680
So, an easier way to do that is to say
split

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,010
out the three groups into separate panels
and make three separate plots.

104
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,040
So that's what we've done here.

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,330
On the left side here, I've got three
different

106
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,970
scatter plots of the displacement versus
the highway mileage.

107
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,520
And then I've split it up by the

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,790
different four, drives, so
four-wheel-drive from in rear.

109
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,230
And so you the relationship for these
three subgroups

110
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,640
and, it's just a different way to look at

111
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,570
the data rather than say, color coding the
three groups.

112
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,550
And I specify this with the facets
variable.

113
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,090
So I can and the facets variable takes

114
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,850
a, a format that's basically, there's a
variable on

115
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,940
the left hand side and a variable on the

116
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,090
right hand side, and they're separated by
a tilde.

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,190
And so if you, the variable on the

118
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,760
right hand side determines the columns of
the panels.

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
And the variable on the left hand side
indicates

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,060
the rows of this kind of matrix here.

121
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,110
Now notice that in the left plot which is

122
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,230
outlined by the red box, I don't have, is
only

123
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,940
one row and so there's no variable that
indicates

124
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,650
how, how many rows there should be in this
plot.

125
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,390
And so that's why in the facets argument I
have a dot on the left hand side.

126
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,290
On the right hand side I've got the DRV
variable,

127
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,700
which indicates that the, that should
indicate how many columns.

128
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,430
Now because there are three levels to this

129
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,680
DRV variable there are going to be three
columns.

130
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,310
And, and so since there is only one row,
there

131
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,278
is going to be three plots all in a row
like that.

132
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,020
On the right-hand side in this plot that's

133
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,950
outlined with the blue box, I've got three
histograms.

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,180
And notice that I put the DRV variable

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,110
on the left-hand side of the facets
argument now.

136
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,056
So that indicates that I want three
separate rows.

137
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,490
Because there's nothing on the right-hand
side of the tilde, I have no columns.

138
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,450
So I just have the one column, no extra
columns.

139
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,360
I just have the one column for the three
plots.

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
And now I've got the three histograms.

141
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,580
You can see, you can look at the highway
mileage.

142
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,940
Divided up by the three groups.

143
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,410
So that's a quick example using the qplot
function

144
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,810
using some of the data is the GGplot
package.

145
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,840
I wanted to go through a slightly more
involved example

146
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,480
using the data set that comes from here
from John Hopkins.

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,490
So this comes from the Mouse Allergen and
Asthma Cohort Study which is

148
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,160
a study conducted here at Johns Hopkins of
Baltimore children, aged five to 17.

149
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,940
These children all had persistent asthma
with an exacerbation

150
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,710
in the past year.

151
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,370
And the overall goal of the study was to
study

152
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,770
the indoor environment, so the home
environment of these children.

153
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,150
And its relationship with asthma
morbidity.

154
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,260
So if you're interested in kind of seeing
what a little bit of

155
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,180
this was about, we have a recent
publication, and I give the link here.

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,930
So here's a little bit of the MAACS data.

157
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,900
You can see that, there's the, there are
750 observations, and I've

158
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,430
just plot, I've just put five variables
here for the sake of demonstration.

159
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,400
One is the ID variable.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,430
The second one is the eno, so the, so

161
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,150
exhaled nitric oxide is is a measurement
that we take.

162
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,270
Roughly corresponds to a level of
pulmonary inflammations.

163
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,490
So a large value of ENO indicates some
pulmonary inflammation.

164
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,810
The second variable that I want to

165
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,430
highlight is fine particulate matter so
this is

166
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,490
this is dust that is less that 2.5 microns
in diameter, so its very fine dust.

167
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,630
The last variable that I want to point out
here is these mouse positive variables.

168
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,730
So, this, this is a skin test that the,
that the, that the children do.

169
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,440
Which indicate, well, and it tells us if
they're allergic to mouse allergen or not.

170
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,990
So so here's the basic histogram of
exhaled nitric oxide.

171
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,910
So this is the log of exhaled nitric
oxide.

172
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,660
And you can see it has kind of an
interesting shape.

173
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,800
There's, there's, kind of, it looks like
there's two peaks, or maybe even

174
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,370
three peaks there, as you make a, as you
look across the histogram.

175
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,080
At the bottom of the plot here, I've got
the code

176
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,120
that makes this histogram, in case you're
wondering how you make it.

177
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,380
And so I use the qplot function to make
the histogram.

178
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,190
I just, so now I've made another
histogram, but I've color

179
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,730
coded the different groups.

180
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,820
And the groups are determined by this
mouse

181
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,770
positive variable, so I've separated out
the people

182
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,320
who are kind of pos, or sensitized to

183
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,600
mouse allergen, and the people who are not
sensitized.

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,340
So the people, you can imagine, you can
think of the, the children that are

185
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,080
Sensitized to mouse allergen are, are, are

186
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,520
more allergic and they may be more
sensitive.

187
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,400
They have more sensitive to a variety of
environmental triggers.

188
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,110
And so you can see that roughly from the
date of the blue

189
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,360
bars are, are slightly higher, and the red
bars tend to be slightly lower.

190
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,600
So, that suggests that the, the children
that are mouse

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,670
mouse positive or have slightly higher
pulmonary inflammation on average.

192
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,640
Another way to visualize this data is to
kind of do a density smooth.

193
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,245
So, you can see that on the left hand side
I

194
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:44,460
ju-, I, I, I add the geom density to this
log(eno) variable.

195
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,110
You can see that there are

196
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,960
clearly, there are at least two peaks from
the density smooth.

197
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,350
And if you separate those peaks out on the
right hand side.

198
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,650
I say, you notice I say color equals
mo-pas.

199
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,970
So that's the, I split out the color

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,790
by whether they're positive to mouse
allergen or not.

201
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,790
And you can see that the each, that the
two peaks

202
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,940
roughly correspond to whether they're
allergic to mouse allergen or not.

203
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,650
And so this is a nice way to visualize
this kind of one dimensional data.

204
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,620
Now if you

205
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,500
want to look at some scatter plots I want
to see whether exhaled

206
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,240
nitric oxide is related to the level of
fine particulate matter in the home.

207
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,480
So I'm going to look at PM2.5 and eno.

208
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,490
And the very left most side here.

209
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,170
You can see I just make a simple scatter
plot

210
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,070
of log eno and log pm 2.5 and it's eno

211
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,430
is a little difficult to see exactly what
the relationship

212
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,630
might be, but we'll kind of go piece by
piece here.

213
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,710
In the middle plot here

214
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,640
I've, I made the same scatter plot but

215
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,180
I've separated the two groups of the mouse
positive

216
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,260
and the mouse and the non, so the
non-allergic

217
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,130
and the allergic children are separated by
different shapes.

218
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,500
So here I specified the shape argument.

219
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,150
And, and I assigned the shape to be this
mouse positive variable.

220
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,050
And now it's not really easy to see the
two groups here.

221
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,440
So that there's one group that's triangles
and another group that's circles.

222
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,830
And because of the overlapping

223
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,650
of the points, it's a little hard to see.

224
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,470
So in the right hand side here, I, instead

225
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,170
of separating the two groups by shape, I
separated

226
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,640
them by color, and it's a little bit
easier

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,820
to see the two different groups in this
plot now.

228
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,840
One of the things you can do is to

229
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,580
smooth the relationship between log PM 2.5
and log eNO.

230
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,500
Now I want to look at how this

231
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,150
relationship is different in the, in the
two groups.

232
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,020
So I, I set the genome to be a point and a
smooth.

233
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,590
And in, and rather than use low S I'm just
going

234
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,920
to say, I'm just going to use a standard
linear regression model.

235
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,150
So I say method equals lm.

236
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:40,610
And that way I can look at the linear
relationship between pm2.5 and

237
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,890
eNO by whether they're allergic to mouse
or not.

238
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,035
And you can see that roughly speaking in
the in the

239
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:50,310
non-allergic children there were some of
these, amongst the red dots, here.

240
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,500
There's a little bit of a negative
relationship, but it's not

241
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,830
particularly strong, if you factor in,
kind of, the confidence intervals, there.

242
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,080
And within the allergic children, there
appears to

243
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,230
be an increasing relationship between PM
2.5 and eNO.

244
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:10,730
so, another

245
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,700
way to look at this same data is to split
it out, with a spli, with, with facets.

246
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,530
So rather than overlapping the two groups,
and,

247
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,250
and then color-coding them separately, I
can just

248
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,430
split them out into two a plots using

249
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,580
the facets variable so, I'm sorry, the
facets argument.

250
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,160
So here I, I specify the facets argument
and I say I want two columns designated

251
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,060
by the two mouse positive variables, no
and yes and so it will be two columns.

252
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,290
And you see, and then I smooth the
relationship within Each panel.

253
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,820
And you can see that again it's the same
story.

254
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,320
Amongst the negative, the mouse negative

255
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,960
children, there's a small decreasing
relationship.

256
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,800
And amounts, amongst the mouse positive

257
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,980
variable children, there's a slight
increasing relationship.

258
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,360
So, the qplot function is a, is a simple

259
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,090
function that you can use to make very
quick plots.

260
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,680
And it's analogous to the plot function.

261
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,010
So you specify x y, you specify your data,
and

262
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,990
then there's a variety of options that you
can choose.

263
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,930
And there a lot of nice built in features.

264
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,250
So if you want to color code subsets of
the data, that's very easy to do.

265
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,970
If you want to split out different panels,
that's

266
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,520
also very easy to do with the facets.

267
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,360
You can choose different plotting symbols
with the shape argument.

268
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
And so, it has it has a

269
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,860
lot of nice things that you can do very
quickly that are still very powerful.

270
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,450
The syntax of the function is somewhere in

271
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,790
between, kind of the base plotting and
lattice package.

272
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,670
I think there are the, the graphics that
are produced

273
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,920
very nice, if you like that the type of
design.

274
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,890
But if you don't, there are features that
you don't

275
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,600
like or you don't like the design of this
particular function.

276
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,660
It's a little bit tricky to kind of modify
the qplot function to suit your needs.

277
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,160
If you want to do kind of a lower, or a

278
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,300
lower level customization of different
aspects of the plot.

279
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,190
You really have to go into the, kind of
the guts of the

280
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,180
GGplot function and that's something that
I'll talk about in the next lecture.
