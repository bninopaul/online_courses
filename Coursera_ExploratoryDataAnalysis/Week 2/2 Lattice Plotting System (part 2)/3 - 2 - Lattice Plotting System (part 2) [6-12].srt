1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,230
So lattice has what are called panel
functions.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,460
So, you know, when you have a multi-panel
plot, there's a function that gets

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,724
called to, to kind of plot the data in
each one of those panels.

4
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:13,640
And that controls what happens to each one
of these panels.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,230
Lattice package comes with a number of
default panel functions, but you

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,800
can supply your own if you want to
customize what happens in each panel.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
And so basically, each panel function
receives the x

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,050
and the y coordinates of the data points
in that

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,750
particular panel.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,230
So remember, each panel's going to
represent a subset of the data,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,870
which is defined by the conditioning
variable that you give it.

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,990
And so you, you, each panel function will,
for each panel, the panel

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,920
function will get the x/y coordinates of
the points that are in that plot.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,710
And so you can see here, I'm generating
some random

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,730
data that are, that are kind of, follow a
linear model.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,410
And I create a factor variable which is

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,430
basically just separating out Group 1 and
Group 2.

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,360
And now I'm going to plot x and y by
group.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,600
And so here I got two panels in Group 1,
it looks like

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,810
a strong linear relationship, and in Group
2, it looks like there's no relationship.

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,320
So you can, here, you can see, I'm, I'm
calling a custom panel

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,190
function, my, via the panel argument, and
I give it, I give it

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,080
a function, so the first two arguments are
x and y, and then

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,220
followed by dot, dot, dot, which means any
other arguments that may get passed.

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,690
And so, in my custom

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,310
panel function, the first thing I do is I
call

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,150
the default xyplot panel function just to
make the points appear.

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,450
And then my customization is I add a
little, a horizontal line at

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,290
each panel, which is the median of the y
values in that panel.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,870
So now I can see there is a dash line in
each panel

31
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,020
right at where the median of, of the y,
the y coordinates is.

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,861
Another fancier thing I can do is rather
than

33
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,928
add the median, it might be useful to add
a

34
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,260
regression line, so you can look at the,
the linear

35
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,890
relationship between x and y within each
of the panels.

36
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,487
So here again, I, I pass a custom
function, and

37
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,077
I call, first thing I do is I call the

38
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:54,250
panel the xyplot function to just kind of
make the

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,550
points appear, and make all the axis
labels, and everything appear.

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:03,110
And then I call panel.lmline to add the
regression line to the panel.

41
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,980
One thing that's worth noting

42
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,660
is that you can't use any of the

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,350
annotation functions from the base
plotting system in the

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,010
lattice system, so any of the functions
that are

45
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,670
in the base plotting system can't be used
here.

46
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,310
As a general rule, you can't mix functions
between different plotting systems.

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,780
And so you have to use all the

48
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,080
functions that are relevant to the given
plotting system.

49
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,480
So as one quick, one more quick example of
showing on a large, larger data set.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,670
This comes from the Mouse Allergen and
Asthma

51
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,660
Cohort Study which was conducted here in
Baltimore City.

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,270
To look at the indoor environment of
children with asthma living in Baltimore.

53
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,080
Many of these children are allergic to
mouse allergen.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
So this is an observational study where,
in which there was a baseline home visit.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,740
And then there was a visit every three
months

56
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,570
for a year, so for a total of five visits.

57
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,880
And so, one thing, one question you might
want to ask is how does the indoor

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,860
airborne mass allergen vary over time and
across subjects.

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,770
So, what I want to do is I basically
want to make a plot

60
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,880
of the airborne, indoor mass allergen for
every subject for every visit.

61
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:13,240
So there are 150 subjects in this data
set, and they each have five visits,

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,597
so you can, so there are going to be 750
data points here that we want to look at.

63
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,050
And so, what's a compact way

64
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,410
to do that?

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,620
Well, actually, a very easy way to do that
is

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,050
use x/y plot, and use a multi panel
lattice plot.

67
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,720
And so that's what we've done here, you
can take a look at

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,730
the data, one, and, and these are all the
subjects in the study.

69
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,180
And this is all their airborne mouse
allergen levels.

70
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,880
Well, it's the log of their airborne mouse
allergen levels.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,840
And so you can see the variation within a
person, so within each panel, you

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,180
can see that their allergen levels can go
up or down, or can vary from

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,550
visit to visit.

74
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,930
You can see the variation across subjects
so you can see that some

75
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,870
people have just very high levels, and

76
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,258
some people just have generally lower
levels.

77
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,870
So it's kind of that cross sectional

78
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,548
variation in addition to the within person
variation.

79
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:02,252
You can see that a number of people have
missing values, so not

80
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:05,551
everyone has five values, some people only
have two values or one value.

81
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,695
And so it may be useful to kind of follow

82
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,375
up on those subjects to see why this
subject only

83
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,681
have four values or three values.

84
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,633
You can see that some subjects, have a lot
of

85
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:19,138
variations, so they go up and down a lot
between visits.

86
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:21,152
And some have almost no variation at all,
and

87
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,820
every visit is the same level of mouse
allergen.

88
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,910
And so you may or may not want to follow
up on some of

89
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,300
this some of these patterns, depending on

90
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,510
what exactly you want, you're interested
in.

91
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,780
And so you can see that with essentially
one or two

92
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,410
function call, you can make a massive plot
like this, look at

93
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,550
a lot of data without having to go through
a lot of code.

94
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,300
And so that's what, that's a, that's part
of

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,230
the power of the lattice system, which
lets you

96
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,610
look at a lot of data, as long as they're
kind of kind of formatted in certain ways.

97
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,110
So again, this is the, the relationship
between the visit

98
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,620
number and the log airborne mouse allergen
levels by subject.

99
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,760
Right, and so this is a very quick way

100
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,650
to kind of summarize all the data in this
study.

101
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,230
So just to summarize, lattice plots are
constructed with a single

102
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,522
function call to one of the core lattice
functions, like xyplot.

103
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,018
Things like, the, one of the nice things
about lattice plots

104
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:15,396
is that things like margins and spacings
and labels are automatically handled.

105
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,277
And so you don't have to set them all the

106
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,899
time using, like you did in the base
plotting system,

107
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,293
where you had the margin option and the
and the

108
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:24,972
kind of spacings and the m texts and the
outer margin.

109
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,080
And so you don't have to worry about

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,076
that very much in lattice plots.

111
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,473
And the lattice system is really ideal
when you have data

112
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,227
sets that you can look at by conditioning
on certain variables,

113
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:37,287
so basically, you typically look, you
want to look at a relationship,

114
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,040
but you want to look at it within levels
of another variable.

115
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,910
So you want, want to look at kind of the

116
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,000
same kind of plot but under many different
conditions.

117
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,480
And you can use the customized panel
functions to modify

118
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,350
exactly what goes on in each of the plot
panels.

119
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,970
And so that gives you a lot of power

120
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,908
to kind of customize the look of these
panel plots.

121
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:59,590
And so I, I find the lattice system very
useful for looking

122
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,430
at kind of a lot of data in a very quick
way.

123
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,330
And so, I encourage you to try to look at
it and look at some of the

124
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,750
other functions, like bwplot, box plots
and scatter

125
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,770
plot matrices to see how they work for
you.
