1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,440
So some of the key base plotting functions
that you'll use a lot of

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,480
course is the, one, the first is the plot
function which makes a scatterplot.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,870
And it can make other types of

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,190
plots depending on whether you're, you're
plotting a

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,210
special type of object, but for the

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,829
most part you usually want to make
scatterplots.

7
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:21,300
Uh,lines is a, is a function that doesn't
create a plot but it adds to a plot

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,855
and so sometimes you want to connect a lot
of dots together so you want to make like

9
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,610
uh,a time series type of font.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,940
You want to make, you want to draw

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,559
lines instead of scatterplot lines is
useful for that.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,870
points, adds points to a plot, so
sometimes

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,440
you want to create a plot, and then you
want to

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,940
add some other points that might represent
a

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,050
different group or a different subset of
the population.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,640
Text as labels, so you want to annotate
the plot with text labels.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,400
Title adds so text can be used, I should
say, to add labels within the plot.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,280
And the title function is typically used
to add annotations outside the

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,140
plot, like x and y axis labels, titles,
subtitles, and things like that.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,890
Mtext is, the m stands for margins, so
it's

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,480
used to place text in the margins of the
plot,

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,375
both the inner and the outer margin, and
the

23
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,400
axis function is for use for specifying
the axis ticks.

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
So here is a couple, a couple examples of
how to

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,480
make plots, and then adding, annotating
them, here I am plotting

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,150
the wind and ozone that I had before.

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,640
Or scatterplot, but now I'm adding a title
to the top of the plot.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,310
So here is the ozone and wind from, in New
York City.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,065
In this plot, I'm again doing a

30
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:31,530
scatterplot, but I, instead of using the
title

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,950
function to add the title, I just, I put
the title directly into the call

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,940
to plot, but then, what I want to do is, I
want to sub-set, I want to kind of

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,370
plot all of the data points that are in
the month of May a different color.

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,860
And so what I do is I subset

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,018
the data frame just to include the
observations from

36
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:53,210
month equals 5, and then I use the points
function to add, to kind of re add points,

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,350
but this time color them blue.

38
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,480
So you can see in the plot below that the
the, they're a subset of

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,680
blue points, and those correspond to the,
to the data points in the month of May.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,915
Now I could do um,um, more subsets so I
can plot them different colors.

41
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:17,260
Cause here I'm, I'm plotting but the
um,the initializing a plot but

42
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,910
then one thing you can see is I added the
argument type equals

43
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,370
n and so what type equals n means it
basically sets up

44
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,820
the plot and initializes the graphics

45
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,580
device but it doesn't actually plot
anything.

46
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,120
So it doesn't put anything into the
plotting region.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,430
It just

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,600
makes a, it sets up all the other stuff in
the plot without the actual data.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,980
And then as I, in order to put the data
into

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,600
the plot, I kind of go through subsets of
the data frame.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,210
To add the data from the month of May, and
add data for the month of not May.

52
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,110
So, for the month of May, I make that
color blue, and then, for

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,810
the other months that are not equal to
May, I just make that color red.

54
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,360
So, you can see all of the other points
are red.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,430
So now, I can kind of accurately see which
ones are blue, which ones are

56
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,090
May, without kind of ov, over plotting
existing points.

57
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,660
And then as a last touch, I add a legend
to the top right part of the plot, so I

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,260
can distinguish, which ones are May, which
ones are not May.

59
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,590
Finally, one common thing you will
typically want

60
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,280
to do is add a regression line or

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,430
a smoother to a plot, so here I've

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,680
just added a regression line to this same
scatterplot.

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,540
So I first make

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,370
the scatterplot and you notice, I changed
the default.

65
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,630
Plotting character pch to be 20.

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,500
So, 20 is a kind of small filled in
circle.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,160
And then I fit a linear model to the data,
which is using the LM function.

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,070
And then I just call the abline function,
which

69
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,440
is another annotation function, ah,and I
just pass it,

70
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,850
the linear model object and I specify lwd
equals

71
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,570
to 2, which is a thicker line than the

72
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,220
typical default line.

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,190
So abline can interpret the regression
model output and

74
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,750
plot a line, plot with a given intercept
and slope.

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,610
And so here you can see, I've added the
regression line to the plot.

76
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,560
Um,and so you can see,and you can see the
downward trend.

77
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,270
So, all the previous plots into the single
plot

78
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,950
that you might, that would appear on the
graphics device.

79
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,820
But sometimes you want to have multiple
plots on a single device.

80
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,050
So here I made two plots.
One plot is ozone versus wind.

81
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,910
And the other one plot is ozone versus
solar radiation using the same data set.

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,150
And so in order to do that I can just

83
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,760
set the par mfrow equals to one row and
two columns.

84
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,420
So I They, I can make the two plots side
by side.

85
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,190
And then I just call plot twice.

86
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,860
So every time I call plot, it creates a
new plot.

87
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,090
And so the first one will be, the in the
kind of left hand side and

88
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,390
the second column plot will be in the

89
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,780
right hand side and that's how I use
mfrow.

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,840
Now, you can see that, when I use multiple
plots, some I have a title

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,570
on each plot so that it tells me kind of
what the two variables are.

92
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,400
And the first one's ozone and wind, second
one's ozone and solar

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,490
radiation, and the third one here is ozone
and temperature.

94
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,660
But sometimes you want to have a label
that's.

95
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,550
Kind of covering the entire panel of
plots.

96
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,210
So that's what the outer margin is for.

97
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,920
So here in this call of the par I set
mfrow equal to one row, three columns.

98
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,600
I set the margins to be a little bit

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,910
smaller than defaults and then I set the
outer

100
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,320
margin to be actually bigger than default,
the b,

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,690
the default for the outer margin is zero
all around.

102
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,200
So on the top I want a little extra space
so I can add the title.

103
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Ozone and weather in New York City, which
is

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,330
kind of a title for the entire panel of
plots.

105
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,900
And then I call plot three times to make
the three plots and then

106
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,140
I use mtext to add the kind of outer title
to this panel of plots.

107
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,480
So that was a quick, kind of introduction
to the base

108
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,080
plotting system, covers some of the basic
functions that you would use,

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
that you would use including plot and

110
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,640
a couple of annotation functions like, A
line.

111
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,150
And points and things like that.

112
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,630
So, it's, you can see that by creating.

113
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,590
And when you create base plots, you are
kind

114
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,920
of building up a plot by function by
function.

115
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,170
And you kind of end up with a, with many
live code to create one plot.

116
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,550
And that's kind of that's how, that's
typical of lots of base plots.

117
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,410
Every plots starts with a function that
initiates

118
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,730
the plot, so like, plot or hist or box
plot, and then a series

119
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,000
of functions which will typically annotate
the

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,370
plot by adding points, lines, text and
legends.

121
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,860
So the, the base plotting system is very
flexible.

122
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,040
It, it gives you a lot of control over all
of the various details of the plot.

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,070
Of course this can be a little bit tedious
if you need

124
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,230
to control everything all the time but
often the defaults are okay.

125
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,510
And but, the flexibility is quite useful
if

126
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,960
you want to make, kind of, publication
quality plots.

127
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,140
and, and, and so, it's nice to have that
de-, that degree

128
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,220
of control, with all, for things like
legends, spacing's and all that.

129
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,160
And so, so that's the, kind of the base
plotting system.

130
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,700
We'll talk more about the other plotting
systems in other lectures.
