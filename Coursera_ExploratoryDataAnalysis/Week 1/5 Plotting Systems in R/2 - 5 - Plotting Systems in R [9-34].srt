1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,546
This lecture's going to be about the
different counting systems in R.

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:08,928
And over time R has developed three core
plotting systems that vary from each other

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:14,393
in slightly different ways, and are useful
for achieving a few different goals.

4
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:17,370
I thought about, I thought I'd talk about
you know the three different systems.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,790
What makes them different, and how they're
useful for various types of plots.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,020
So the first system that I'll talk about
is, is, is usually referred to as the

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,440
base plotting system.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,390
The base plotting system is the oldest
system in R.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,130
It came with the original version of R.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,440
and, the kind of conceptual model that it
uses

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,940
for building plots is a kind of artist's
palette model.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,340
The idea is that you're kind of, you're,
you're kind of, you have a blank canvas.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,190
And then you kind of add things to it one
by one.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,090
So first you create the, a box with some,
maybe some points in it.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,100
And then you add labels.
And then maybe you add a regression line

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,720
through it.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,610
And then maybe you add titles, and, and,
axis ticks, and things like that.

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,090
And so you kind of piece together this
plot, one by one.

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,890
Every little piece of the plot takes
another

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,450
line of code, or another couple lines of
code.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,316
And so you kind of add to it one by one.

22
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:05,492
So this is a kind of intuitive

23
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:07,795
model, because of, especially when you are
exploring

24
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:11,123
data because you may not know right away
what's the plot that you want to make.

25
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:13,561
And so maybe you'll just throw some points
on the canvas,

26
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,091
and then you'll add some colors, then
you'll add some labels,

27
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,826
and then eventually you'll piece it all
together.

28
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,202
And so this is all well and good as long
as you're kind

29
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:24,905
of keeping track of all the code that you
used to make the plot.

30
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,700
Then you can always reconstruct the plot
later.

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,920
And so the typical mode is for this type
of model is to

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,402
use the plot function so, there's always a
function that generates a plot.

33
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:40,760
And then and there are other functions
that so called, annotate the plot.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,144
And these

35
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,824
are functions that add things like text,

36
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,890
lines, labels, things like that, to the
plot.

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,230
So the generation, and then there's the
annotation.

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,700
so, the nice thing about the system that's
very convenient, it's kind of intuitive.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,130
I think many people think of building
plots in this manner.

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,250
But one of the, one of the drawbacks is
that you can't go back, so if

41
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,230
you, if you make a plot and you add
something to it, you can't take it away.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,840
So it's kind of a it an increasing

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,920
process or a kind of cumulative process.

44
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,720
It's difficult to translate the a new plot
to another person.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,550
So for example, if you develop a new kind

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,630
of plot it's, there's really no way to
translate

47
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,450
that, those ideas to another person,
because there's no

48
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,470
language, there's no kind of conceptual
language to use.

49
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,990
Every plot is just a, is just a bunch of R
code basically.

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,780
And so and so that's a little bit of a
drawback sometimes.

51
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,510
Another drawback

52
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,390
with the base plotting system is that
every, is because you have

53
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,530
so much control over the system, you
therefore have to control everything.

54
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,230
And therefore set everything very
carefully

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,649
if you don't like the default values.

56
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,190
So here's an example of a very simple base
plot.

57
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,520
You can see what a base plot looks like.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,150
In this I've used a dataset called the
cars dataset which shows

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,570
the speed at which a car is moving and the
distance at

60
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,190
which it takes to bring, to bring the car
to a full stop.

61
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,310
And so you can see it's just a simple
scatter plot

62
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,380
with speed on the x axis and distance on
the y axis.

63
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,470
And so base plots look like this.

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,210
You could add a lot of other things.
You could add a title.

65
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,090
You could add labels in the plot.

66
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,680
You could make the points a different
color.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,810
You can make them in different shapes.

68
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,390
There's all kinds of options that you can
choose

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,250
from and we'll talk about that in detail
later.

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,860
The second major plotting system

71
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,270
in R is called the Lattice System.

72
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,470
And this is implemented in the Lattice
package.

73
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,740
So this, the idea here is actually quite
different from the base plotting system.

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,490
Rather than piecing a plot together one by
one through a

75
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,960
series of commands, every plot is
constructed with a single function call.

76
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,530
And so the most commonly used function is
going to be the function xyplot.

77
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,450
But there are other functions like bwplot,
etc.

78
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,090
And so these functions basically construct
an entire plot

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,330
all at once.

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,950
And so therefore, you have to specify a
lot of information in the call to the

81
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,360
function, so that it has enough data to
build a plot and in an appropriate way.

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,430
The last system is most useful for

83
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,550
what are called, Co-plots or Conditioning
Plots.

84
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,420
Where you have, you want to look at the
relationship between,

85
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,460
let's say x and y as it changes across
levels of z.

86
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,190
And so, there, the, so you.

87
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,400
You're conditioning on different levels of
z and then you're

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,030
looking at x and y at each one of those
plots.

89
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,402
These are some times called panel plots.

90
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,226
because you're looking at the same thing
in every

91
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:25,250
panel but just for different levels of a
third variable.

92
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,080
And you can even combine variables so you
can look at multiple factors.

93
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,000
So the system is very useful, because you
can put a lot of plots on a

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,080
page very easily and very quickly as long

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,310
as you kind of follow this conditioning
model.

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,270
And then, furthermore, a lot of the
details that you would have

97
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,860
to specify directly in the base

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,310
plotting system are kind of calculated
automatically.

99
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,860
So things like the margins and a

100
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,590
lot of the spacings, are calculated
automatically as

101
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,120
long as you can accept the, those defaults
then most things will look quite nice.

102
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,220
So the downside of the Lattice system is
that sometimes it's, it's going to

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,510
be very awkward to specify an entire plot
using a single function call.

104
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,020
And sometimes you, it, it seems more
natural to kind of

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,410
piece things together one by one, like in
the Base system.

106
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,550
the, it's difficult to annotate a plot,
especially after the

107
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,820
plot's been generated, you can't add
anything to the plot.

108
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,310
It's done, and if you want to add
something,

109
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,730
you kind of have to reconstruct the
function call altogether.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,450
There is a

111
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,910
way to annotate each of the individual
panels in

112
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,640
a Lattice plot, but it's a very tricky and

113
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,370
a not very intuitive use of functions like
panel

114
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,550
functions or things like subscripts, which
is not very intuitive.

115
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,590
And finally like I said you can't add to a
plot once it is done.

116
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,980
So here's a basic Lattice plot.

117
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,970
I use some data from the Lattice package.
And I basically plot life expectancy.

118
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,720
So the average life expectancy

119
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,970
in a state, versus the average per capita
income in that state.

120
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,540
This is data from the late 60s, early 70s
and, and then

121
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,930
I condition on the region of the country
that the state is in.

122
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,560
So the, the country is divided into four
regions.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,610
And you can see it, look at the
relationship between income and

124
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,740
life expectancy by state within each, or
sorry, across states with, by region.

125
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,230
And so you can see that this type of panel

126
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,780
plot is very, is just a single function
call, in

127
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,120
Lattice.

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,686
I use the xy plot function and its

129
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:17,558
very simple to construct where something
like this.

130
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:20,650
And the base plotting system would involve
many different lines of code.

131
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,460
It would be much more involved.
So

132
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,610
the last system, plotting system that I
want to talk about is the ggplot2 system.

133
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,695
So this comes from the the grammar of
graphics which is

134
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:38,150
which lays out a set of principles for a
kind of plotting.

135
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,950
and, and it creates a kind of language

136
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,130
or grammar for describing different
aspects of a plot.

137
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,924
So it's based on a kind of well grounded
kind of rigorous theoretical system.

138
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:50,267
And it's implemented in R in the gg2,

139
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,880
ggplot2 package.

140
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,608
It kind of splits the difference between
the Lattice

141
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,690
and the base package, so it mixes ideas
from both.

142
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,760
So on the one hand you can kind of build
the plot incrementally

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,810
by adding things one by one, so that's
kind of like the base system.

144
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,110
On the other hand a lot of the kind

145
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,210
of aesthetic calculations are done
automatically without you having

146
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,070
to directly control, so things like
spacings and labels

147
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,920
are all kind of put in the right place.

148
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,040
So that's kind of like the Lattice system.

149
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,150
The ggplot2 system is very useful for
conditioning plots just like in Lattice.

150
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,620
And so you can make those kinds of panel
plots.

151
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,508
And the default of, the default so the
ggplot2 system has a lot of defaults.

152
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,390
And if you can accept them, it's quite
handy.

153
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,240
But you can always customize them if you
don't like what the defaults are.

154
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,920
And so if you know how to

155
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,520
use the Lattice system, you, the
transition

156
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,280
to ggplot2 is not too difficult, although
there

157
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,190
are some differences that are worth, that
I'll

158
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,830
talk about in in the lecture on ggplot.

159
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,140
So this a typical ggwhat default ggplot2
plot.

160
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,130
Here I, here I used the miles per gallon

161
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,890
data set from the ggplot2 package and I'm
plotting on

162
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,050
the x axis the kind of, the displacement
or

163
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,430
it's actually the size of the engine of a
car.

164
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,290
And the y axis

165
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,540
is the mileage on the highway for that
car.

166
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,350
And you can see that roughly as the size

167
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,250
of the engine is increasing, the mileage
is decreasing.

168
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,700
And so you can see that the ggplot2

169
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,750
package creates plots in a slightly
different aesthetic.

170
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,520
There's a kind of a gray background with
white grid lines.

171
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,680
The default is to use solid circles rather
than open circles.

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,370
And so you know, these things, you can
always customize if you want.

173
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,340
But the defaults are a little bit
different than the other two systems.

174
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,970
So, just to summarize there are three
basic plotting systems in r.

175
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,610
There's the base plotting system and there
is, which is kind of has this.

176
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,610
Artist palette model, where you kind of
add things one by one.

177
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,660
There's the Lattice system which you kind
of

178
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,870
specify an entire plot using a single
function call.

179
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,610
And then there's the ggplot2 system which
looks, which

180
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,780
kind of mixes the custom ideas from both
systems.

181
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:57,980
One of

182
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,650
the important things to know when you're
using

183
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,790
these three systems is that they can't be
interchanged.

184
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,090
You can't use them interchangeably.

185
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,160
So if you're going to use the base
plotting system, you

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,450
have to use all the functions associated
with that system.

187
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,770
Similarly if you're going to use the
ggplot2 system, you

188
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,190
have to use all the functions associated
with that system.

189
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,990
So you can't mix the functions between
systems.

190
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,600
Because otherwise you'll get, the plotting
will be confused.

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,000
And so so you typically have to choose a
system and kind of go with it

192
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,080
when you make your plots.

193
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,980
So those are the three main plotting
systems in R and then in,

194
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,100
in separate lectures, I'll cover in detail
how to use each one of them.
