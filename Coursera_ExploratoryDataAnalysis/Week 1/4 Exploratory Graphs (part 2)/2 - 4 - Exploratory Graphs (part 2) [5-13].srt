1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,620
So that we've gone through some one
dimensional summaries and now

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,650
I want to talk a little bit about some two
dimensional summaries.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,350
Which include things like scatterplots,
but also you can, you can, you can kind of

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,250
group together lots of one dimensional
plots

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,080
to look at mult, two dimensional data.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,350
And in particular Lattice and GGplot are
good at this.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,742
so, we're going to look at scatterplots
smooth scatterplots and also,

8
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,430
and in, looking at two, greater than two
dimensions then

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,370
you have to get a little bit more clever
in terms of how

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,310
you present the data because one

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,800
possibility of course is actual
three-dimensional plots.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,850
Where you might need you know, 3D gla-,
you know, a set of glasses to wear them.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,900
These are not usually not that useful.
But I have seen them.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,760
You can have spinning plots, which would
allow you

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
to kind of move the data around in three
dimensions.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,400
These can be useful sometimes.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,908
But often the most useful techniques are
to take a two

18
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,872
dimensional plots and kind of array them
or, or, or organize

19
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,525
them in a special way so that you can

20
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:56,053
look at a third variable or even a fourth
variable.

21
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:59,430
Uh,and so we'll talk a little bit about
these methods.

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,970
You can also use things like color and
size and

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,990
shape of, of plotting symbols to add
dimensions to your data.

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,830
So here's a way to look at two dimensional
data.

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,200
I've got in one dimension the east west
variable which is categorical.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,930
And the other dimension I've got the pm2.5
variable.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,274
And you can see that

28
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:20,520
I've got two box plots, one for east and
one for west.

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,300
And you can see that in the east and on
average the pm2.5

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,260
tends to be quite a bit higher than it is
in the west.

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,630
And and so that's a nice summary of, of
these two dimensions.

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,930
Now on the, in the west you see that on
average it tends to be a little bit lower,

33
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,660
but that, all of the extreme values of the

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,590
distribution so to speak are in the
western United States.

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,360
So the west has an average that's

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,040
lower but it has generally a larger
spread, so that's kind of interesting.

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,355
You can do a similar type of plot with,

38
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,640
with histograms instead, so now I've made
a histogram

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,930
on top which is the eastern counties, in
the

40
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,660
histogram on the bottom, which are the
western counties.

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,790
And you see the same basic features.

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,980
The western counties tend to be lower on
average,

43
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,075
but they have more extreme values that are
higher.

44
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:05,930
[COUGH] And the eastern counties are
generally higher on average, but they tend

45
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,809
to be but they don't have those kind of
very high, extreme values.

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,220
So of course one of the easier things to
do,

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,420
the most obvious things to do is a scatter
plot.

48
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,080
And here I'm plotting the latitude of the
monitor in the county versus

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
the pm2.5 just to see if there are any,
you know, north-south trends.

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,229
So as the latitude gets increases you're
going north.

51
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,530
And you can see that there aren't, these
are

52
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,968
there isn't a very strong particularly
strong north-south trend.

53
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:38,770
it does seem that the, the the pm2.5

54
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,660
tends to be higher in the middle
latitudes, and not

55
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,270
quite as high in the, in the upper and
lower latitudes.

56
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,990
I've added a d, a horizontal dashed line
here at 12, so

57
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,840
you can see roughly where the national
ambient air quality standard is.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,420
And you can see that there are a number of
dots that

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,740
are above it, which are technically
speaking would be out of compliance.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,050
So you can use color to add another
dimension.

61
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,460
So for example, if you remember there was
the latitude and the longitude and

62
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,510
the east-west variable in this dataset.

63
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,790
And so what I've got on the X-axis here is
the latitude, and the Y-axis, the pm2.5.

64
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,320
And then I've added the color.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,397
So the, the, the red and black dots
indicate the east and west variable.

66
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,365
And so the the black dots are the east
counties and

67
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:23,277
the red, sorry the black circles are the
eastern counties and

68
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:25,909
the red circles are the western counties
so you can see,

69
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,160
now you can see we are looking at three
different variables here.

70
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,590
Another way to look at these variables is
to, just to make two plots.

71
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,490
So now I've got a panel of plots.

72
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,730
On the left hand, left hand side I've got

73
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,610
all the western counties and on the east,
on

74
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,978
the right hand side I've got all the
eastern

75
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:47,480
counties and I'm plotting them by latitude
and pm2.5.

76
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,000
So you can see that in the, in both cases
the

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,510
kind of higher pollution- counties tend to
be in the middle latitudes.

78
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:55,820
and,

79
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,770
and the north and south, northern and

80
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,640
southern latitudes tend to have generally
lower pollution.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,130
This is both the case in the eastern

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,090
and western United States, so that's kind
of interesting.

83
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
So that's a quick summary of the, the,
kind

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,280
of plotting one dimensional and two
dimensional data in R.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,230
and, and, even using color and multiple
panels for

86
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,010
looking at three dimensions that are
greater than two.

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,570
And in general these exploratory plots are
meant to be quick and dirty.

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,960
Notice I didn't spend any time working
with

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,406
the axes or you know, or setting the
labels.

90
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:27,290
and, and so I just kind of use the
defaults

91
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,990
and for the most part use the defaults in
R.

92
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,530
But the nice thing about exploratory plots

93
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,350
is they let you summarize the data and
highlight any you

94
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,470
know, broad features in the data which may
be of interest.

95
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,730
You can explore kind of basic questions
and hypotheses.

96
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,460
So remember, the question, the basic
question that we were looking at was,

97
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,670
you know, whe, are there any counties that
may be out of compliance?

98
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,940
And these plots may suggest useful
modeling strategies for the next step.

99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,500
Which may be ana a more detailed analysis
or model fitting.

100
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,840
Lastly here's just a couple resources.

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,240
There's a nice website called the R Graph
Gallery which has

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,180
lots of examples of, of graphics and plots
made in R.

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,224
And of course the R Bloggers website will
often highlight lots of,

104
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,310
you know, plots that people have made and
have published to their blogs.

105
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,300
So take a look at those to get a sense of
what's possible.
