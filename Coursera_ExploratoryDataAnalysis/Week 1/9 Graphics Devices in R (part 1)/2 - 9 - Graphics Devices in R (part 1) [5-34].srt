1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,710
Graphics devices in R are very important
because we need them to make plots.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,990
There are many different types of graphics
devices that

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,890
we can on which we can make plots, and so

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,270
this lecture's going to cover, just
briefly the various different

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,160
graphics devices that are available to
most users of R.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,090
So, first of all, what is a graphics
device?

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,890
So very simply, a graphics device is, is
something

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,980
or some place where you can make a plot
appear.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,860
So the most obvious

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,070
place for, for a plot to appear is on your
screen, or, or a window on your screen.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,820
And so when you open up R, and you call
the plot

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,470
function, a window, a graphics window
launches and your plot appears there.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,870
So that's called the screen device.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,620
Other places where you might want to send
the plot include things like files.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,420
And so files come in a variety of formats.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,852
You can have a PDF file, a PNG file, or

17
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:50,750
a JPEG file, or, or a scalable vector
graphics SVG file.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:50,970
And so

19
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,750
there are a lot of different file devices
that you can

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,240
choose from, and you can send a plot to
those files.

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,750
So any time you make a plot in R, it has
to be sent to a specific graphics device.

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,400
otherwise, it, that, it, it's, there's no
way for it to be generated.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,120
The most, and the most common place for a
plot

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,590
to be sent is this, this, is this screen
device.

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,032
So, the screen device on the Mac, is
called

26
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:16,090
a quartz, on Windows, it's called windows
and on the,

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,940
on Unix/Linux systems it's called x11.

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,900
So when you make a plot, you, the, you
first

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,850
have to think about where's this plot
going to show up.

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,920
And there's a full list of the devices
that are available to you under

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,298
the devices help page here, which you can
call up with the question mark devices.

32
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:37,220
There are also graphics devices that have
been created by users on

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,210
CRAN, that you can make available to R, by
installing those packages.

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,470
We won't talk about those here.

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,952
I'm going to focus mostly on the devices
that come with R.

36
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:47,747
so, when you're

37
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:50,132
plotting data and you're doing some
visualizations

38
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:52,517
and exploratory analysis and kind of
looking through

39
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:56,430
some data, usually the most obvious place
to send a plot is the screen device.

40
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,050
So you call a plot function like plot, or
xyplot, or maybe you're

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,040
using qplot and ggplot2 and the plot will
go to the screen device.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,302
And then you can look at your data, very
quickly, and see if you

43
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:08,600
want to make a, see what you're going to
do for the next plot.

44
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,780
on, on any given platform, whether you're
using a Mac or

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,600
Windows or Unix, there's only one screen
device.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,010
So, you don't have to make any choice
about, you

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,610
know, what screen device you're going to
send it to.

48
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,550
There's only, there's only one place to
go,

49
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,290
and so, you don't have to worry about it.

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,790
Now, however, usually after you've done
some

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,760
exploratory analysis and you've kind of
figured out,

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,960
well, what plots are things that you want
to keep or you want to include.

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,700
Or maybe you want to send a plot to
someone then you have to,

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,970
you have to make the plot on another type
of device, you for example,

55
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,390
a file device.

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,780
So when you make a plot in a file then you
can take that file.

57
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,230
You can include it in a report.

58
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,550
You can include in a, in a presentation
that you're making.

59
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,240
Or maybe you can email it someone.

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,470
And so files are more, much more useful
for that type of purpose.

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,160
So there are many different files devices
to choose from unlike with the

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,120
screen device and so we'll talk about some
of those file devices here.

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,110
It's important to realize that not every
graphics device that I talk about in

64
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,270
this lecture, will be available on all
platforms.

65
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,010
And so, for, for example, there's no
Windows device on a Mac or

66
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,060
on a UNIX system and similarly there's no
quartz device on a Windows system.

67
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,290
So, you won't be able to open every single
graphics device on every platform.

68
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,500
so, how does a plot get created?

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,880
And this might seem a little obvious, but
there's

70
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,530
actually more than one way to, to create a
plot.

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,480
So the first one is which is the, kind of
the simplest approach

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,400
and probably the one that you're most,
you're already familiar with is that

73
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,890
you call a plotting function like plot, or
xyplot, or qplot, and the

74
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,710
plot just appears on the screen or the
screen device I should say.

75
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,356
And then you can annotate the plot with
functions like text or title or

76
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,500
ac, or or things like that.

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,560
And then once you finish annotating your
plot and

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,010
it looks the way you like it, then that's
it.

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,530
You're finished.

80
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,210
The plot is on the screen and you can look
at it.

81
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,548
You can show it to someone else on the
screen.

82
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:59,595
So here's some code that just loads the
dataset and creates a plot using the plot

83
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:03,810
function and then it adds a title to the
top of the plot and then that's it.

84
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,730
So, it's, that's a very simple way to
create a plot on the screen.

85
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,810
Another way

86
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,390
for creating a plot is most commonly used
for file

87
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,450
devices and it's, and it involves
explicitly launching a graphics device.

88
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,500
So you might open a file device, and

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,120
then you create the plot using plotting
functions.

90
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,560
You can in the case of, if your using

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,460
a file device it's a little bit tricky
because

92
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,910
the plot will not actually appear on the
screen,

93
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,420
because all the plotting information is
going into a file.

94
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,040
And so you have to know exactly what
you're doing when you create a, a plot

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,720
to a file because you won't be able to see
it on the screen.

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,010
So typically, the best way to do this is
to save your code, your

97
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,950
plotting code, in a separate file and that
way you can just kind of

98
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,640
cut and paste the code into R, and you,
and you don't have to

99
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,660
worry about, you know, making a, making a
mistake while you're typing the code in.

100
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,660
So after you create the plot, you annotate
it if you need to.

101
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,520
Then you have to close the graphics device
with the function dev.off.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
Once you've closed the graphics device
then the,

103
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,570
the plot is complete and if you send it to
a file, you

104
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,010
can open the file in your computer or you
can look at it.

105
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,480
You can include it in some, in a re,

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,000
in a presentation or you can email it to
someone.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,768
So here's some code that just opens the
PDF device here, with the PDF function.

108
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:18,340
You have to give it a file name so I just
call, called it myplot.pdf.

109
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,580
And then you have to make the plot, do
some annotation

110
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,310
and then you have to close the plot with
the dev.off function.

111
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,520
So, once I've called dev.off there should
be a file in my

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,960
working directory called myplot.pdf and
you can open that with any PDF viewer.
