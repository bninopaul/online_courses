1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,080
This lecture's going to be about
constructing exploratory graphs which are

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,510
graphs that you make more or less for
yourself, so that

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,220
you can look at the data and explore kind
of what's

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,180
going on in, in the data sets that you're
looking at.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,410
And so, I mean, the basic question that
we're trying to ask

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,800
here is, you know, why do we use graphs in
data analysis?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,940
And there are a couple of different goals
that we want to achieve

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,170
here, you know, understanding the data
properties,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,680
finding patterns in the data basic
patterns.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,060
Maybe just suggest some modeling
strategies, you know?

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,100
Do we want to use a linear model or a
nonlinear model to debug an analysis?

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,730
So maybe you started doing an analysis,
and you

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,010
want to figure out, you know, what's going
wrong.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,556
And then we want to communicate results,
too.

15
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:43,390
So we want to present things to people in
a graphical form.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,430
And exploratory graphs are really about
the first four things on this list here.

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,290
So we want to basically understand
properties about our data,

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,770
we want to look at some basic patterns
suggest some

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,400
modeling strategies and and to debug an
analysis.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,460
But in this particular lecture, we're not
going to

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,700
be talking much about how to build graphs

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,310
for communicating results, and we'll talk
about that

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,420
in a little bit later in other lectures.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,260
So some of the characteristics of
exploratory graphs

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,880
are that they, they tend to be made very

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,360
quickly, so they are kind of made on the
fly as you are looking through the data.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,920
You tend to a large number of them because
you want to look a

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,660
very different aspects of the data, you
know, look at lots of variables and

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,447
you have to go through them kind of one at
a time often.

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,540
And the goal is for you to develop a, as

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,400
the analyst, to develop a personal
understanding of the dataset.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,840
And to get a sense of, you know, how how
it looks.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,620
What are the properties, what are the
problems?

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,950
and, and what are the things that need to
be followed up?

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,150
It's just, just so you can get a sense of,
kind of what the data's looking like.

36
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,240
So you if you can think of an,

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,900
an, an underlying question essentially of
all exploratory

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,080
data analysis, it might be you know, what
do my data look like?

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,710
And so and so this is the goal for making

40
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,160
exploratory graphs and a lot of the things
that you typically

41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,060
worry about, you know, later on in terms
of appearances of

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,575
a graph or how it's presented you don't
worry about now.

43
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:00,810
So things like the axes and the

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,160
legends are typically going to be cleaned
up later.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,530
Things like and color and sizes are
primarily

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,490
used for, for you to kind of separate
information.

47
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:08,920
But you might,

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,270
if you were going to present this in a, in
a different setting for example in a

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,370
presentation or a talk you might think a

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,610
little bit more carefully about color and,
and size.

51
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,090
So, I, I just want to go through a
specific example in this lecture just so

52
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,920
we can talk about the various types
exploratory

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,770
graphs that you might make using a real
dataset.

54
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,380
So here this dataset is, it involves air

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,650
pollution ambient air pollution in the
United States.

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,270
And it comes from the US Environmental
Protection Agency,

57
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,310
which sets national ambient air quality
standards for outdoor air pollution.

58
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,970
And the particular type of air pollutant
we're going

59
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,650
to look at is called fine particle
pollution of pm2.5.

60
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,780
And the standard in the United States is
that the annual mean averaged

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,640
over three years at a given location

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,470
cannot exceed 12 micrograms per meter
cubed.

63
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,710
And so any state that exceeds this level
of 12 micrograms per meter

64
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,880
cubed when you take the annual mean and
average it over three years

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,980
is considered to be out of compliance with
the national standards.

66
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:11,400
And so there's data available for on pm2.5
from the US EPA's air quality system.

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,300
And so I've downloaded that data and
summarized

68
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,240
it here just for the purposes of this
presentation.

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,670
And the basic underlying question in this

70
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,110
exploratory analysis is just going to be
are

71
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,970
there any counties in the United States
that

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,770
exceed the national standard for fine
particle pollution?

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,200
And so

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,130
we have, we have monitoring data from many
counties

75
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,730
in the United States where air pollution
is a problem.

76
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,660
And we want to see whether or not they
exceed the

77
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,210
12 microgram per meter cubed standard,
that's, that's recently been set.

78
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,270
So the data here are available.

79
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,910
You can read the menus in the read.csv
function.

80
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,920
And I've put the code here so you can take
a look.

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,130
And here are the first couple lines of
this data frame.

82
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,730
And so there is the first column is the
level of pm2.5.

83
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,460
It's the, it's the annual average [COUGH],
sorry it's the,

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,990
it's the annual mean averaged over the
past three years.

85
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,620
So, a, actually it's the years 2008
through 2010 and

86
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,350
then the fips column that's the, it's an
identifier column that's

87
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,300
for the county.

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,090
And then the region is just whether,
whether

89
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,600
this county is in the east or the west.

90
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,390
The longitude and latitude, basically, is
a is,

91
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,280
is the locations of the monitor in that
county.

92
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,320
The longitude and latitude coordinates for
the monitor in that county.

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,620
So we basically remember this is the
underlying question is we

94
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,260
want to see do any of the counties exceed
the standard of,

95
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,930
of 12 micrograms per meter cubed?

96
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,630
Even in an exploratory analysis where
you're just kind of, you

97
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,902
know, looking through the data and seeing
if there are any problems.

98
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:43,890
You, you, you still want to have kind

99
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,790
of an underlying question that you're
thinking about in

100
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,280
the back of your mind, even if it's a

101
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,270
little bit of a vague question at this
moment.

102
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,060
Because the question that you ask will
drive your thinking about what the data

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,542
look like, and so something that may be a
problem for one type of question,

104
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:00,960
may be not a problem for a different type
of question.

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,710
So when you look through the data you

106
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,240
have to have a background question kind in
mind.

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,250
So, we want to see if counties exceed this
national ambient air quality standard.

108
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,640
So a couple of, so we can look at one
dimensional summaries

109
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,970
of the data, and here are a couple that I
list out.

110
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,400
One is a five number summary.

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,150
There's boxplots, histograms, density
plots and bar plots.

112
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,820
And I'll illustrate a few here.
So, I mean, the first

113
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,590
one is the five number summary which is
really not a plot at all, obviously.

114
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,420
But it's a, it's a summary of just some

115
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,020
particular aspects of a, of a, of a given
variable.

116
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,470
And so, the summary function in R can
produce the summary,

117
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,780
and actually it's the six number summary
because it includes the mean.

118
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,380
The traditional five number summary is the

119
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,810
minimum, the first quartile, the median,
the third

120
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,990
quartile, and the maximum, and the summary
function just puts the mean in there, too.

121
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,500
So here you see the median

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,590
is ten micrograms per meter cubed which is
under the standard.

123
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,950
The maximum is 18.4 which is over.

124
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,344
So, there must be some counties that
violate

125
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:01,480
the standard at least during this time
period.

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,530
And so and the things, you can see the
third quartile is

127
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,520
11, and the first quartile is 8.5, and the
minimum is 3.38 here.

128
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,530
So, here's a boxplot of the pm2.5
variable,

129
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,600
and I just I decided to color it blue.

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,970
And you can see that the median is about

131
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,700
ten, just as we saw in the five number
summary.

132
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,110
And you can see that there are a number of
counties

133
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,728
that appear to be over the 12 microgram
per meter cubed limit.

134
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,300
And then there are some, there are many
that are that are under it.

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,580
That are, so that are in compliance.

136
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,360
Here's a histogram of the same data.

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
And so the nice thing about the histogram
is that you get a little

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,230
bit more detail about you know, the shape
of the distribution of this variable.

139
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,770
And one

140
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,660
nice thing that I like to do is to put a
rug underneath the histogram.

141
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,420
So the rug basically plots all of the

142
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,040
points in your dataset that, along
underneath the histogram.

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,720
So you can see exactly where the points
are that make up the histogram.

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,930
And so you get, on the, on the one hand
you get the histogram

145
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,680
which is a summary, but you also get some
fine detail with the rug underneath.

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,340
So you can see, you know, where the
outliers

147
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,660
are, and where the bulk of the data are.

148
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,960
So you can see that the, the bulk of the
data seem

149
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,190
to be centered around ten or so.

150
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,700
But there are couple of outliers kind of
above beyond 15.

151
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,380
One thing you can do with a histogram is
change the breaks, the

152
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,930
number of essentially the number of bars
that are going into the histogram.

153
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,340
And so you can see in the previous slide
the bars are

154
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,540
kind of wider so the, the histogram is a
little bit smoother.

155
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,890
But in this slide I made the, the

156
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,100
bars smaller by setting the breaks equal
to 100.

157
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,960
And you can see

158
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,190
that you get a little bit more of a
rougher histogram.

159
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,520
And so one of the things that you have to
worry

160
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,060
about when, when you set the breaks
argument is that you

161
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,080
don't want the number to be to big so that
you

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,720
get lots of little bars and then the
histogram becomes very noisy.

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,610
Of course, you don't want the number to be
too small, because then you just

164
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,790
might get a few bars and you can't really
see the shape of the distribution.

165
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,170
So, it's, it's usually useful to play
around

166
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,050
with the breaks argument, just to adjust
the

167
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,620
number of histogram bars there are, so as

168
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,750
to get the histogram that you like the
best.

169
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,330
Here's the box plot that I showed you
before, but now I've overlaid some a

170
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,778
feature onto the plot, which is just a
horizontal line at the level of 12.

171
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,770
So number 12 is the national ambient air
quality

172
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,830
standard, and so I've overlaid the line
right at, right

173
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,200
at 12 just to get a sense of, you know,

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,630
how many what counties are above and below
the line.

175
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,048
So you can see the bulk of them, over 75
%,

176
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:23,400
are below the line because in the entire
blue box is below

177
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,120
that line.

178
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,730
And the upper end of the blue box is the
75th percentile or the third quartile.

179
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,460
So, that's useful for sumari-, for kind of
pointing out specific features.

180
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,340
You can do this on a histogram, too.

181
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,476
So here I've put a vertical line at, at
12, so that's the black line.

182
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,620
And I put a, another vertical line, which
is

183
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,120
in magenta, at the median just so you can
summarize.

184
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,740
You can see exactly where the median of
the distribution is.

185
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,550
That was easy to see in the box plot
because the box plot contains

186
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,645
the median as a feature.

187
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,100
But the histogram does not and so it's
sometimes nice

188
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,530
to put a vertical line in there to
highlight the median.

189
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,380
So you can see that again that the median
is below the

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,920
standard, but there are a number of
counties that are above it.

191
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,650
A barplot is another graphical summary for
categorical data.

192
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,860
And here I'm plotting the, the region
variable so that you can see how

193
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,890
many counties there are in the east and
how many there are in the west.

194
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,240
So you see that the, the majority of the

195
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,980
counties are in the eastern part of the
United States.

196
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,280
And the there are a little over a hundred

197
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,870
counties in the western part of the United
States.

198
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,920
And so that just summarizes this

199
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,980
particular variable which is a categorical
variable.
