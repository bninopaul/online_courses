1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,940
So here I started up Bar, and I'm just
going to do a little bit of

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,260
simple plotting just to kind show what
the,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,298
the basics are of the the plotting
options.

4
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:10,670
So, I'm going to simulate a little, a
little bit

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,240
of data here just so I can make a plot.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,058
A hundred normal random variables here.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:20,080
And I'm going to call Hist to make a
histogram, of the plot.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,600
So the first thing you'll notice when I
call Hist, is that a plot window opens up.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,290
So let me just move it over here.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:26,870
And the

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,150
histogram of the data is shown.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,390
And so you can see that even though I
didn't specify any arguments in

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,870
the Hist besides the data themselves a
number of things appear on the plot.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Without my specifying them.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,590
So for example, there's a title here.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,280
Then there's an x label here, so here the
label is

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,130
just x because that's what the object
called when I passed hist.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,290
The label here is frequency which is the

19
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,170
default for histogram so it tells you the
number of elements

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,530
within this range, so for example, between
minus one and zero.

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,950
There's going to, there's a little over
thirty elements of the vector in that

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,049
range, and you can see that the histogram
is roughly like a normal distribution.

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,126
So let me just generate some more data
here.

24
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:17,416
So we can make a little scatter plots I'm
going to generate

25
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,341
some more data.
And I'll plot xy here.

26
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,906
So now, the plotting window is already
open, so when

27
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:25,950
I call plot it's not going to launch a new
plotting window.

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,496
It's going to send the plot to the current
plotting window, which is this one here.

29
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:33,580
So, I've speci-, I've called plot and you

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,710
can see the mixed scatter plot of the
points.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,770
The default plotting symbol here is an
open circle.

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,540
You can see.
And again

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,870
the label, I didn't specify besides x and
y but

34
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,510
that a number of things have occured in
the plot.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,505
For example the label here is specified as
x on the

36
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,760
x-axis, and the label on the y-axis is
specified as y.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,290
If I had changed the name of the objects,
so let's

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,310
say I say [UNKNOWN] here, and I plot x and
z.

39
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,140
Well the plot looks different because the
data are different but you

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,650
can see that the label here turned, turned
to Z because that's

41
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,530
the name of the object.
So let me just go back to x and y.

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,430
And so a number of things on the plotting

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,940
region are important for example the
margins here are.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,440
There's four margins here, one for each
side.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,240
This is side one.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,328
This is side two.

47
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:30,480
This is side three, and this is side four
over here.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,380
And you can see that the margin for the
bottom is

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,930
is, is the largest.

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,620
So there's, there's five lines of margin
text available.

51
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,790
On the side two, there's four lines of
margin text available.

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,720
On the top, there's also four, so, side
three.

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,030
And on the right side, side four, there's

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,790
the smallest amount of a margin text
available.

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,780
So you can adjust that using the Mar
function.

56
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,960
So for example, I can just say par, and
then I say Mar equals, let's say

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,880
I want two on every side.
So two, two, two, two.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,430
Excuse me.
And then I can plot again.

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,439
And you can see that now the plot the
margins have gotten a

60
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,830
lot smaller and the plot kind of extends
farther out into the window.

61
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,420
But the problem you can see is that on the
x and the y axis, I lost my label.

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,750
And so even though I have the tick marks
there I don't have my x and y labels.

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,200
So we probably

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,750
need to make them a little bit bigger than
that.

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,444
So maybe I'll say four, four.

66
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,100
Like that.

67
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,600
So now if I plot again now you can see
there's

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,500
just enough room for the x and the y label
there.

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,310
I'm just going to demo a couple of the
other options that

70
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,980
may be of interest to you as you're cri,
constructing your plot.

71
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,940
So first is the plotting symbol I can say
plot, x,y then PCH equals, say 20.

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,390
That gives me a solid circle here.

73
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,283
I want a slightly solid symbol here, I
would say PCH equals 19.

74
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,430
Or I can, you know, specify PCH equals
two, that gives me

75
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,770
triangles, three gives me little plus
signs, four gives me x's, etcetera.

76
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,090
So you can see, so you can see that
there's many

77
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,600
different plotting symbols to try, you
might be wondering how I

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,940
know all the numbers for these plotting
symbols, well, it just

79
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,070
comes after many years of use, I've
memorize most of them all.

80
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,830
But, of course, if you haven't memorized
them quite yet a

81
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,100
handy tool is the example file for points.

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,470
So if you just say points examples are
points.

83
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,950
It'll go through a number of Demos so you

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,030
can see the capabilities that R can do
with plotting.

85
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,240
But most important is their little plot

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm sorry little chart of the symbols
here.

87
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,730
And so you can see that's for example one
is

88
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,000
the circle, two is the triangle, three is
the plus etcetera.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,350
Here at 20 was the solid circle small, 19
was the larger circle if you wanted the

90
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,710
solid square that's 15.
Solid triangle is 17 etcetera.

91
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,210
So you can

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,550
specify what type of symbol you what and
you just by, using the number here.

93
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,340
Another things, if you notice the symbols
21 through 25.

94
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,350
Those are actually symbols that are
similar to say.

95
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,920
But to ones that are, have been previously
shown, just for example, one thru six.

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,310
However the difference is in 21 through
25, those symbols have a

97
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,710
have have boundaries so you can see the
boundary is red and they have a fill which

98
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,540
to this case is yellow.

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,540
So you can specify the two different
colors, one for

100
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,820
the boundary of the outline and one for
the color.

101
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:34,310
And so the boundary color specified using
the col col argument.

102
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,730
And the, the background color, the fill
color, is specified using the bg argument.

103
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,970
So you can specify two different colors
like that if you

104
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,150
want.

105
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,140
Here's another chart of the plotting
symbols, and

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,770
you can continue through the demo here for
points if you want.

107
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,690
And I'll just finish it up here.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,460
Just some of the special symbols that you
can plot if you want.

109
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,550
This is in a different font and let me
just click out of here.

110
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,920
So so that's one way to Change the symbol
here.

111
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,420
I'm going to go back to my plot here.
I'll say pch equals

112
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,290
let's say 20.

113
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,650
Excuse me.

114
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,215
I have to regenerate my data because it
was overwritten by the example.

115
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:37,700
[NOISE]
So here's my data again.

116
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,580
My little scatter plot.

117
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,870
Now, I can add a title to the plot by
using the title.

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,640
Now I'll just say this is my scatter plot.

119
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,230
And that adds a title.

120
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,800
I could add some text if I wanted to, so
for example,

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,710
I could use the text function to say add a
little label here.

122
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:05,050
Let's see, I'll give it the coordinates
I'll say minus 2 and then minus 2.

123
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,320
See that the label appears there.

124
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,560
I can add a legend if I wanted to.
Say the legend.

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,790
And the legend, you can give it, kind of
location specifications.

126
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,530
So, for example, top-left will put the
legend in the top-left.

127
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,420
And then I'll say

128
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,890
I'll just give it a stupid label, excuse
me let me

129
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,460
just pull plots in there so now I've got a
legend there.

130
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,180
So there's all kinds of annotations that
you can

131
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,850
add to the data as you kind of go along

132
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,230
so for example if I want to plot a line to
the data I could fit a linear model.

133
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,150
A lot that using the LN function.
Then the AD line function

134
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,650
will add the linear model fit on top of
the here and the data aren't related

135
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,090
to the other, each other so that the
linear model is the line is pretty flat.

136
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,340
If I wanted to adjust the thick, thickness
of that

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,060
line, I can use the AD line and specify
the LWD.

138
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,820
To be let's say three.

139
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,340
And you see that.

140
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,870
Now, a new line is plotted over that,
which is much thicker.

141
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,560
So you probably wouldn't want to do this

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,130
from the get go.

143
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,880
If you wanted to remake this plot, you'd
probably just

144
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,530
specify from the get go, LWD go up to
three.

145
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,980
You don't want to necessarily plot two
lines on top of each other.

146
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,960
But, I'm just showing this for demonstra-
Demonstration sake.

147
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,020
I could have also changed the color.

148
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,460
So make the color, say blue.
And that would make it blue.

149
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,590
And so there's lots of different types of
options you can specify here.

150
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,130
When you're, as you're making the plot

151
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,230
So usually, you're going to want to create
x labels and y

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,970
labels which are kind of, represent what
the data are.

153
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,490
So you can plot, you can put a lot of
these options in the plot function itself.

154
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,930
So I can say plot x,y and, and maybe x-lab
is let's say, weight.

155
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,090
And then y-lab, or y-lab, will be, say,
height.

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,304
The main will be scatter-plot.

157
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,970
PCH will be 20.
So that gets.

158
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,400
Now, I have actual labels on the X-axis
and Y-axis.

159
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
I can put my legend back if I want.

160
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,590
Maybe I'll put it in the top right this
time.

161
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,495
And then I can add my little line here.
So I can say, fit is,

162
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:36,578
[BLANK_AUDIO]

163
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,718
Or maybe I'll make the line red this time.

164
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:43,680
So, that's my plot, with the labels of the
linear regression line.

165
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,570
And with the legend.

166
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,610
Now let's see what happens when we try to
put more than one plot on the page.

167
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,720
So for example, let's say I have another
variable, which I'll call z, and

168
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,350
maybe it's a, I don't know, maybe I'll
make us some Poisson data here.

169
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,660
Oh, excuse me.

170
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,660
And let's say I want to plot z versus x
and that

171
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,100
I also want to plot y versus x on the same
canvas here.

172
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,030
So the first thing I can do is let's say I
want to put,

173
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,170
let's say I want to put the plots right on
top of each other.

174
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,430
So let's say par mf row equals so that
it's going to happen, I

175
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,720
want to have two rows of plots and then
one column of plots, right?

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,510
So that's what we want to see.

177
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,060
So now I'll apply the x and y on the top,
and x and z on

178
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,090
the bottom.
So x and y, so PCH equals 20.

179
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:35,070
So you can see that goes on the top, and
on the bottom here,

180
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll give x and z say it equals 19, and
that goes on the bottom.

181
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,130
So now you can see that the margins are a

182
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,980
little bit large here, lar, probably
larger than we would want.

183
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,450
and you see that the, that the margin that
I have, that's specified here.

184
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,340
Is

185
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,170
that.

186
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,810
And so we want to adjust the size of the
margin now

187
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,930
that we've kind of re- rearranged the
configuration of the plots.

188
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,290
So we can maybe say something like

189
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,420
par, let's see, par equals

190
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,940
Now if I plotted again,

191
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,790
they get a little bit bigger.

192
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,390
So like 20 again.

193
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,760
So that's how, now I put two plots on the
screen.

194
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,190
I could have done it the other way.

195
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,530
I could have said instead of them having
top

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,750
and bottom, I could have had them right
and left.

197
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,380
So by saying par name of row, equals a 1,
2.

198
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,650
Now I can plot like this

199
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:44,930
like that.

200
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,640
So you can see, I made the margins a
little

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,050
bit too small, because I lost my y-axis
label here.

202
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,526
So maybe I'll just say par.

203
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,440
I'll go back to four, four, two, two like
this.

204
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,880
And make it positive

205
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,750
again.

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,490
So you can see that when you've rearranged
the plotting layout, you might want

207
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,960
to rearrange the canvas itself to kind of
remove some of the white space.

208
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,980
I won't do that for the moment, just so I
can continue with the demo here.

209
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,450
But for example, you can put four plots on
a page.

210
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,670
Like say, mar equals, sorry, mf row.
Equals 2, 2.

211
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,370
That means two rows, two columns, so I can
say plot x and y.

212
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,310
That'll go in the upper left.
And you see, now, I can plot x and z.

213
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,170
You might wonder, well, where's the next
plot going to go?

214
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,540
Well, because I specified mf row, the
plots are going to go across the row.

215
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,240
So the next plot's going to be in the
upper right.

216
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,210
And then the next plot's going to be in
the lower left

217
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,500
so let's say I'll plot z and x instead of
x and z.

218
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,890
And then the last plot's going to go in
the lower right here.

219
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,240
So that, now I've got four plots on

220
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,410
a page by specifies, specifying the mf row
option.

221
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,810
If I'd specified mf call the same thing
would have happened but the order in which

222
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,650
the plots occurred Would have been
different, so now I can say plot x, y, and

223
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,370
that appears in the same place, but the
next

224
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,080
plot now is going to appear on the lower
left, and

225
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
the next plot's going to be in the upper
right,

226
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,400
and the last plot's going to be in the
lower right.

227
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,190
So that's the difference between mf row
and mf col.

228
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,650
The last option I'll talk about here is
the points function, just as

229
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,240
a demonstration to how you can annotate a
plot by adding things to it.

230
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,280
So, let me just reset the plot region so

231
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,030
that I'm only doing one plot at a time
here.

232
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,650
Now suppose I generate some data and, and

233
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,030
suppose the data consists of say, men and
women.

234
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,690
So there's two groups of people, here.

235
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,850
So I'm just going to generate some data
here.

236
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,470
And maybe I'll give them a little
relationship,

237
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,760
so it not, a little bit more interesting.

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,860
And let's say I've got another variable
here which is the group and it's going to

239
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,460
be half and half so the two groups in the
fifty level fifty iterations of each.

240
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,820
Let me just give them names.

241
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,750
We'll say labels.

242
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,500
So, I got males and females in this group
of people here.

243
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,140
You can see it is a factor variable of two
levels.

244
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,120
So, suppose I wanted to plot the data.

245
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,910
If I just plot the data X and Y you can't

246
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,780
tell who are the males and who are the
females, right?

247
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,970
Because they're all the same color for
example and So, suppose I want to plot the

248
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,580
data and plot the, make the males

249
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,080
one color and the females another Another
color.

250
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,070
So how do I do that?

251
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,300
So the first thing you want to do, the
basic idea is

252
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,170
you're going to set up the plot region,
but

253
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,830
you're not going to plot any of the data.

254
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,430
And then you're going to add the data by
gender, so you're going to

255
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,910
maybe add the females first, and then add
the males, and the

256
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,280
idea is that each time you add the data
points, they'll be

257
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,810
of a different color, or perhaps a
different plotting symbol, or whatever.

258
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,710
So first, let's set up a plotting region,
so I'm

259
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,660
going to say plot xy So I'm going to pass
at the data.

260
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,350
But I'm going to say type = N.

261
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,840
So this means make the plot, but don't
actually put the data in there.

262
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,130
So you can see that when I hit,

263
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,480
execute this function, everything happens
just like before.

264
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,580
The labels are put in.

265
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,250
The tick marks are put in.
The margins are specified.

266
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,170
Everything is there, except for the data.

267
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,730
So the only thing that's missing is the
data.

268
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,450
And so what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to add the

269
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,410
data, but I'm going to add them one group
at a time.

270
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,490
So let's say I add the males first.
So I can say points x, and then

271
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm going to subset the vector so that the
g, I

272
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,530
only take the points where g is equal to
male.

273
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,510
Right, so that's a subset.

274
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,430
And then I'm going to say y, and then g is
equal to male.

275
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:46,430
So this is only going to plot, plot the
points, so where where the values of the

276
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,590
g variable are equal to male, let say I'm
going to set, make the, that color green.

277
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,640
Okay.

278
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,740
So next I see the points on the, on the
screen, are green.

279
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,510
Those are, those represent the male points
only.

280
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,040
So I can do the same thing for the female,
so

281
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,480
I can say points x and then g is equal to
female.

282
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,900
And the y g is equal to female.

283
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,880
And let's say I'll make these, blue.

284
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,280
So now you can see that there are blue
circles

285
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,400
for the females, and there's green circles
for the males.

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,710
And so you can see the two groups,
separately within the scatter plot.

287
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,860
And so, sub-setting based on a grouping
variable is very common when making plots

288
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,800
and the points function can be used to
kind of add points sequentially by group.

289
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,960
So that you can specify different types of
properties for each group.

290
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,700
You can also, in addition to varying the

291
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,200
color I could have changed the plotting
symbol.

292
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,110
So I could have said pch equal to let's
say 19.

293
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,670
So this is a kind of solid circle here.

294
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,500
And that would have given me a solid blue
circle

295
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,060
for the females and an open green circle
for the males.

296
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,630
So that's one way to separate out.

297
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,060
Groups of data points on a single scatter
plot.
