1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,590
This lecture's going to be about some

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,758
basic principles for building analytic
graphics.

3
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:08,696
The basic goal is to provide some general

4
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:11,147
rules that one can follow when we're
building

5
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:13,598
analytic graphics from data, and we're
trying to

6
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:16,740
tell a story about what's happening in the
data.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,730
I find these rules to be quite useful when
thinking

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,159
through building data graphics and they
apply to many different situations.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,230
so, I've kind of cribbed these rules from,
a book by Edward Tuffey.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,830
I'll give

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,810
the reference at the end of the lecture.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,740
This is from his book, Beautiful Evidence,
where he,

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,560
where he kind of goes through a number of
principles,

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,260
and so, I'm going to talk through some of
these ideas

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,700
and kind, and kind of show them, in, in
context.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,950
So, the first principle, that Tufty talks
about, is to show comparisons.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,540
And this is a very basic idea in all of
science.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,020
And the basic idea is that evidence for a
hyp, for a hypothesis or an idea about

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,440
the world, is always going to be relative
to another hypothesis, right?

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,990
So evidence is always relative.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,670
And so, if you're comparing Hypothesis A,
there has to

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,660
be some alternative hypothesis that you're
going to compare it to.

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,850
And so, so whenever you hear a statement
or hear a a summary of

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,600
evidence, based on data you should always
be asking a question compared to what?

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,140
Alright, so here's a quick example.

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
The basic idea is that

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,170
we have a, a boxplot which looks at the
effect of an air cleaner

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,820
on the asthma symptoms of children who in
a certain, in a set of homes.

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,620
So the idea is that an air cleaner was
introduced

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,280
into a child's home, to reduce indoor air
pollution levels.

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,630
And we want to see if their asthma
symptoms are improving.

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,170
So the outcome is, it's what's called
symptom-free days.

33
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,250
So a higher number is better.

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,270
And here we can see that the group of
children that got the

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,540
air cleaner in their home had an increase
in their symptom-free days.

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,590
About, on the median increase was about
one symptom-free day over 2 weeks.

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,880
So that's a positive outcome, and we might
be inclined

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,100
to think that of course that the air
cleaner works.

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,450
But of course, the real question is
compared to what?

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,366
So what do we compare the air cleaner to?

41
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:05,504
And so the, the what we compare them to in
this case, is nothing.

42
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:08,490
So our, our control setting where

43
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,600
the air, or the control set of houses are
have

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,370
no air cleaner, and just kind of live
their daily lives.

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,340
So this was a randomized control trial
that looked

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,270
at installing an air cleaner in a child's
home.

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,620
And, and, and installing nothing in the
child's home.

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,550
And you can see now that in the control
homes,

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,030
the average change in the symptom free
case was about 0.

50
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,260
So there's really no change.

51
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,350
And then the average change in the air
cleaner

52
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,530
homes was about 1 symptom free day for, 2
weeks.

53
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,530
And so, just now you can

54
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,390
say okay, well relative to doing nothing,
the air cleaner is actually

55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,000
a little bit better at showing an
improvement in the child's symptoms.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,610
So it's always important to show a
comparison in a plot.

57
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,610
So that you can, you can have a basis to,
to compare what you're

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,170
showing and, c, so you can compare

59
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,370
the evidence to, between 2 different
hypothesis.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,790
The 2nd basic principle, is to show
causality or mechanism or,

61
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,440
to, to make an explanation and to s, to

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,460
kind of show what's going on, show some
systematic structure.

63
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,900
So I mean, the, the use of the

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,400
word causality here is not supposed to be
formal.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,890
But rather, is just to show kind of what

66
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,330
you believe, and how you believe the world
works, right.

67
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,240
So you need to be able to show what, how

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,170
you believe the system is kind of
operating, so to speak.

69
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,849
And so so what's the causal framework for
thinking

70
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,600
about the question that you're kind of
interested in?

71
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,854
And so if I might extend the

72
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:26,818
example from the previous slide,
previously we saw that

73
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:29,155
if you install an air cleaner in a child's
home,

74
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:32,518
that on average, they're going to
experience a one symptom-free

75
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:36,270
day increase, so a better outcome in their
asthma symptoms.

76
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,460
Now, we might ask, okay, well why does
that occur?

77
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,310
Why is it that installing an air

78
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,790
cleaner in a child's home, improves their
symptoms?

79
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,746
Well, of course, we hypothesize that the
air cleaner is cleaning the air.

80
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:49,176
It's removing particulate matter from the
air, and

81
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:52,740
so this particulate matter that's not,
that's being removed, is no longer

82
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,440
going in the child's lungs, and no longer
triggering their asthma symptoms.

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
So that's kind of how we believe things
work.

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,790
And so we can show a plot, that might
corroborate that evidence.

85
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,970
And so we can show another plot, which has
the symptom free days on

86
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,120
the left hand side, and then the

87
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,430
particulate matter, on the right hand
side.

88
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,550
So now we can see what was the effect of

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,380
the air cleaner on the, on the particulate
matter levels

90
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,510
inside the child's home?

91
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,960
And you can see that for the control
group,

92
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,300
there was basically no change in the
particulate matter levels.

93
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,520
Maybe in the slight increase, in the, in
the levels.

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,050
But there was a pretty, substantial
decrease in particulate matter levels.

95
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,120
For the group of homes that got the air
cleaner.

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,020
So now we can see that not only did a
child's symptom free

97
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,530
days increase when they got the air
cleaner, that they're that they're indoor

98
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,590
air particulate matter levels decreased,
also when

99
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,150
they got the air cleaner on average.

100
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,170
So, we can think about, you know, what is
the explanation for,

101
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,590
you know, why the the air cleaner seems to
improve symptoms in children.

102
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,010
And we can, and we can show, using the
data that

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,210
we observed, that it does seem to decrease
their particulate matter levels.

104
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,840
Now, of course, to really confirm that
this

105
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,950
hypothesis that the air cleaner operates
through, by reducing

106
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,030
PM, we'd have to do a lot, a

107
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,110
little bit more investigation and perhaps
more experimentation.

108
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,009
But this graphic kind of suggests a
possible explanation.

109
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,290
The third principle that that [INAUDIBLE]
talks about is to show multivariate data.

110
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,020
And the basic this rule can be boiled down
to

111
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,910
show as much data on a single plot as you
can.

112
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,486
And the reason is because, data are, the
world is

113
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:30,020
inherently multivariate, there's lots of
things going on all the time.

114
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,478
And if you just plot 2 variables, or maybe
even 3 variables.

115
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,130
It's not going to show the real picture of
what's happening in the world.

116
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,313
So if you can, you can integrate, if you
put

117
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:44,000
a lot of data on a plot, then you'll be
able to tell a much richer story.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,250
So here is an example of a plot which is
another air pollution

119
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,890
example, but now we're, this a, a, if data
comes from outdoor air pollution.

120
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,420
So on the X axis we have, particulate
matter less than 10

121
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,030
microns in aerodynamic diameter, the
concentrations of those, from day to day.

122
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,710
So, every circle on this plot represents a
daily concentration.

123
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,400
And on the y axis, we have

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,670
the daily mortality in New York City.
This is for the time period 1987 to, 2000.

125
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,130
And you can see that overall, when, there
seems to be

126
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,225
a night-, a slightly negative association
between PM 10 levels and mortality.

127
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,810
Cause you can see that the regression line

128
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,260
that I put through there, is slightly
downwards sloping.

129
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,060
So that seems interesting, cause you
might,

130
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,650
one might hypothesis that higher air
pollution

131
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,570
levels might be associated with higher
mortality, not lower mortality.

132
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,300
So but you can look at other variables.

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,850
So there's not just air pollution and
mortality that

134
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,530
is kind of, kind of, that is of interest
here.

135
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,780
There are other variables that may be of
interest.

136
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,700
And may kind of be part of the system, and
may confound this relationship.

137
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,070
So, one of the things that we can look at

138
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,550
is see, well, how does this relationship
change across different seasons.

139
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,520
So if you look at, you know,

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,810
particulate matter and mor-, and mortality
in winter,

141
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,370
spring, summer, and fall, what does that
look like?

142
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,950
So, we can make a, a different plot to
show that relationship.

143
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,470
And this is the plot that we can make.

144
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,910
So this plot shows the relationship
between pm10 and mortality.

145
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,160
So, it's the same plot as we saw as we
showed

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,120
on the previous slide, but it's split
across the different seasons.

147
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,038
So we see it separately for winter,
spring, summer, and fall.

148
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,810
And we can see that in each plot, the
relationship is actually

149
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,029
now slightly positive.

150
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,650
So within each season, the relationship
between PM and mortality is

151
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,080
positive, but if you look overall, the
relationship appears to be negative.

152
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,370
So this is an example of Simpson's
Paradox.

153
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,420
If you may have heard it.

154
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,390
But the basic idea is that the season in
which we look

155
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,900
at the relationship, is confounding the
relationship between PM 10 and mortality.

156
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
And so when we look across with with the
[INAUDIBLE]

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,950
we look at the relationship within each
season it changes.

158
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,550
So it's important to show as many

159
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,750
variables as is reasonable at a given
time,

160
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,791
so that you can sh, get a clear picture of
the relationships in your data.

161
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,700
So the fourth principle is to integrate.
The evidence that you have.

162
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,990
And, and the basic idea here is that you
want to use as, as

163
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,020
many different modes of evidence, or as,
or displaying evidence as you can.

164
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,970
And so there's no reason to say if you're
just, if you

165
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,100
have a tool that makes a plot, to only
show a plot.

166
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,680
Or if you only have the ability to make a
table, to only show a table.

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,290
You should be able to combine different
modes

168
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,360
of evidence into a single presentation,
to, to make

169
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,600
edit, to make your graphic or whatever
display

170
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,210
that you're making as information rich as
possible.

171
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,050
And so, the idea is not, is not to let the
tools

172
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,850
that you use to drive the kinds of plot
that you make.

173
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,280
You should make a plot that you want to
make,

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,700
and not just let the tools do the
thinking.

175
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,250
And so what, that's one of the nice
advantages

176
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,560
of a system like R, because the, the tools
are

177
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,350
very flexible in R, and you can make all

178
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,430
kinds of customized plots to show the data
and to

179
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,930
kind of integrate different modes of
evidence.

180
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,639
So this is just one very quick example
from a published paper.

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
In the Journal of the American Medical
Association, looking at

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,250
the relationship between coarse
particulate

183
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,850
matter and hospitalizations in the
elderly.

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,460
And the basic idea is the details of this
plot are

185
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,950
not particularly important, but I just
wanted to show that they're,

186
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,076
there are kind of point estimates here,
which are in the

187
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:14,590
solid circles, and then there's confidence
intervals indicated by the lines

188
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,660
going through the confident, through the
solid circles.

189
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,350
But then on the right hand side here you
see this

190
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,900
label called posterior probability that
the relative risk is created in 0.

191
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,450
And so this is a measure of the strength
of the evidence

192
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,040
that the, the kind of the association
between coarse particulate

193
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,710
matter, and, and hospitalizations is, is,
in fact, different from 0.

194
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,760
And so, so here, we integrate, the, the,
kind

195
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,600
of, the point estimates as, as dots and
lines.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,430
Then we also have texts on the right which
also, it shows another piece of

197
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,590
evidence, which is kind of the strength of

198
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,000
that evidence, as encoded by the posterior
probability.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,890
So you can use these kinds of tools to put
lots of

200
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,940
information on your plots.

201
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,630
And now, I have to resort to putting
diff-, putting information

202
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,180
in different places where they may be
difficult to track down.

203
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,650
The fifth principle is to det-, to
describe and document the evidence

204
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,000
that you present, with using labels and
sources and, and whatever, and, and,

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,770
and in particular, if you're going to be
making a plot with, a system

206
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,860
like R, it's important to preserve the
computer code that made the plot.

207
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,070
So the idea is that you want to lend

208
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,290
some credibility to the evidence that you
present.

209
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,250
So, sources of where the data came from
that's very

210
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,880
important and how you made the plot is
also important.

211
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,820
So that's a very basic principle and it's
important

212
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,340
for your credibility.

213
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,520
The very last principle of course is that,
content is king, so if you don't have

214
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,890
an interesting story to tell, then there's
no

215
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,938
amount of presentation that will make it
interesting.

216
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,416
So when, when you're making plots, when
you're making figures, and you're making

217
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,850
graphs, the first thing about what's the
content that you're trying to present?

218
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,550
What's the story you're trying to tell?

219
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,690
What's the data that you have?

220
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,880
And then think about well what's the best
way to present that?

221
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,870
How am I going to present it?
And what is it

222
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,640
going to look like?

223
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,122
Because if you don't have very good
content, then there's

224
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,470
really not much you're going to be able to
do beyond that.

225
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,435
So just to quickly summarize the, the

226
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:04,370
6 basic principles are, first show
comparisons.

227
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,990
Always show something relative to
something else.

228
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,830
Show causality or mechanism, or explain at
least

229
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,060
try to explain how the system is working.

230
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,360
How the world is working, at least
according to your ideas.

231
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,910
The third is to show multivariate data.
So always try to show

232
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,600
more than 2 variables, because the world
is complex and involve many variables.

233
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,130
Principle number 4 is integrate multiple
modes of evidence.

234
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,160
So that you can use things like tables and
plots and texts all together.

235
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,580
You don't have to keep them separate, if
you don't want to.

236
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,230
Describe and document your evidence.
Always have sources and, and source code.

237
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,250
And, and, to lend credibility to your
plots.

238
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,290
And finally, always remember that the
story that you tell

239
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,320
and the data that you use are the most
important

240
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
elements of any graphic.

241
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,780
So just the, the P reference that I would

242
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,090
use for this presentation is, Edward
Tufte's book, Beautiful Evidence.

243
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,702
And you can, you can read about it at his
website which I point to here.

244
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:59,350
It's an excellent book, I highly recommend
it.

245
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,510
So, so that's some, these are some basic

246
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,750
principles about building analytic
graphics, and then we're,

247
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,476
and, in, and in future lectures we'll talk
about how to do that using the various

248
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,730
plotting systems in R.
