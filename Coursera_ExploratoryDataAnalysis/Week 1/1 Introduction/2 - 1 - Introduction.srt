00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,370
Hi, everyone, welcome to Exploratory Data
Analysis.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,170
This is the fourth class in the Data
Science Specialization.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,890
So at this point you should have, you
should be familiar

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,330
with all the kind of basic tools in the
data scientist's toolbox.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,160
You should you know, be familiar at least
with the kind of the basics of R

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,680
programming in terms of writing functions
and writing

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,200
writing kind of basic, kind of basic
operations on data.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,890
And we should have covered the kind of the
aspects getting data

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,018
from the internet and through various APIs
and kind of processing data.

10
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:29,640
So now you've got, you can imagine, you
have got your data set.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,550
It's been through a variety of processing
steps and it's time

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,500
to just kind of look at and see what's
going on, right?

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,950
So you want, so the purpose of this class
is to look at your data, get

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,510
a sense of what's happening and what are
the kinds of plots that you want to make.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,670
One of the types ways that you can explore
the data without kind of having

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,800
a precise or specific model about, you
know,

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,460
what's supposed to be going on in there.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,510
So this is before we do modelling, before
we

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,730
do prediction, before we do any sort of
inference.

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,520
And so we're going to talk about the
plotting systems in R.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,550
We're kind, talked about kind of basic
principals about making analytic graphics

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,000
and I'll show some case studies of
exploratory data analysis just so

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,030
you can get of sense of kind of how this
type, how

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,570
this kind of thing would work in a, in the
real world.

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,710
So I hope you enjoy it.

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,470
I look forward to seeing you in the class.

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,760
And I think this will set you up really

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,660
well, for the later classes in the data
science specialization.
