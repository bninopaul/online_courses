1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,292
In this video I want to talk about 2
things, how to set

2
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:08,746
your working directory and how to edit our
code files in Windows.

3
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:11,000
So you can see I've got R started up here,
and the first

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,340
thing you're going to want to do is figure
out what your working directory is.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,510
Because the working directory is where R
finds all

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,630
of its files for reading and writing on
your computer.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,830
So you can find out what yur working
directory is

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,130
currently set to be by using the Get WD
function.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,050
And you can see it's set to be,
c:/users/rdbanks/documents.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,360
This may differ on your computer.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,380
Depending on what version of Windows
you're using.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,600
and, and what hardware you're using.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,850
But there'll be some directory.
Probably on your C drive.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,735
Now, It, the reason why it's important to
know and to set your working directory is

15
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,320
because when you read data or when you

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,610
write things out using functions like read
or

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:58,904
write CSV, they will be read or written to
your home, your working directory.

18
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:01,010
So for example if I do something

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,440
like read.csv I want to read the say
mydata.csv.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,700
If the file is not in my working
directory, you'll get an error.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,850
One that looks much like this because it

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,710
can't find the file in the working
directory.

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,070
So one possibility is that you can, if you
know

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,680
where this file is, you can move it to
your

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,030
working directory.

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,650
Or, or you can change your working
directory

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,130
to be wherever this file happens to be.

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,020
So I can go the File menu here, and choose
Change deer.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,070
And I'm going to go into my local disk
here,

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,960
users, already paying I go to my desktop
here.

31
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:42,540
So now, if I type DIR, I'll get a list of
the files that are on my desktop here.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,510
In seeing that, lo and behold here is
mydata.csv file.

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,238
So now I can say read.csv and then
mydata.csv.

34
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,180
And you can see that the data will be
printed to the

35
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,620
console because now we can find the file
in my working directory.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,550
So one nice thing, one thing that I
suggest that you

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,770
do for this course, is that perhaps create
a single directory or

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,580
single folder where you can put all of
your materials for the course.

39
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,900
And not have to worry about them being
scattered all over the place.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,790
Any time you download something from the
website

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,980
or create a new file, it's probably best
to

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,720
store it all in one folder so that you

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,070
don't have to be searching all over for
it.

44
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,610
That way, you can always set your working
directory to be that,

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,990
to be that directory and not have to worry
about changing it.

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,740
So I'm going to minimize R here for a
second.

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,310
I'm going to create a folder

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,820
on the desktop.
Calls I'll just call it Coursera, and

49
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,030
then I'm going to use this folder for
everything that I do in this course.

50
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,080
So if I go back to R here, I can say
change

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,230
working directory again, changed here, and
I can go to local disc.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,810
Users, RDping.

53
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,920
Now this folder is on my desktop, so
desktop

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,035
then it's Coursera here.
So now I'm going to say get WD.

55
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:07,530
Let's see the working directory has
changed to this Coursera folder.

56
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,660
So one of the things you're going to have
to do

57
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,680
a lot of in this class is to write R code.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,290
In order to write R code, you need to be
able to use a text editor.

59
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,370
luckily, R comes with a rudimentary text
editor

60
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,320
which will be definitely sufficient for
this course.

61
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,910
So you can load at the text editor by
going to File,

62
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,810
and say New Script.

63
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,770
And this will give you a blank window,
that you can use to write our code.

64
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,840
So I'm going to write a simple function
here, it's going to

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,840
be my function [NOISE] it's not going to
take any arguments, and

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,040
all it's going to do it's going to
simulate some normal random

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,790
variables, and then it's going to take the
mean of those guys.

68
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,720
Alright.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,410
So this is a simple function.

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,700
Now the question is how do I get this R
code into my R consoles that

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,380
I can actually use the function, because
you'll

72
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,470
notice if I go into my R console here.

73
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,620
I type my function.

74
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,160
it's, I can't find the function because I
haven't loaded into R yet.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,540
If I type LS, you'll see that there's
nothing in my

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,190
workspace right now because I haven't
loaded any R code into there.

77
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,780
So how do I get the R code into the

78
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,118
R console?
Well there's two ways.

79
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:18,329
If you just have a little bit of code like

80
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,441
this function over here, I can click into
my R editor.

81
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:25,261
And if just hit hit Ctrl + A to select
all, and then Ctrl + C to copy.

82
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:29,000
Then I click back into the console, and I
can hit Ctrl + V to paste.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,330
Now I've just pasted the code into R and
you'll see

84
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,200
that if I type LS, I've got my, my
function there.

85
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,930
I can execute it by just calling it, and
you'll see it'll give you the mean

86
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,180
of 100 random.

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,630
Normal random variables, if I do it again,
it will give me

88
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,126
a slightly different number because it
will simulate a different set of numbers.

89
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:50,654
The other thing you can do is go into my
R-editor,

90
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:54,740
and you can go to the File menu and click
Save As.

91
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,560
So now you can, if you save, you can hit
Save As, you can

92
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,730
save the file into your Coursera folder
here, which I'm going to do right now.

93
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,090
And you can

94
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,615
save it as whatever name you want.
So I'm going to call it my code .R.

95
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:13,090
.R is conventional for the extension.

96
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,330
So now if I type dir, excuse me.

97
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,060
In my console window here, you'll see that
there's a file called mycode.r.

98
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,270
And you can load this into R, using the
source function.

99
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,372
So I can say mycode .r.

100
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,730
And that loads the all the code that is

101
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,440
in this file, of course that's just the my
function.

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,712
So, I haven't done anything new here.

103
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,540
But let's say, I want to add another
function here.

104
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,879
We'll say, second for my second function,
and it will take an argument X

105
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,260
and it will take X, it will add a little
bit of noise to it.

106
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,080
So, With the R in arm function.
Okay so now I've got two functions here.

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,690
I can save my file with this little disk

108
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,050
icon, or I can go to file, the File menu,
hit Save.

109
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,559
And I'm going to source this file again.

110
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,284
Now, when I type LS, you'll see that I've
got this 2nd function there.

111
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:12,830
And I type 2nd, let's say 4.

112
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,720
I get a number that's 4, plus a little bit
of random noise.

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,080
So let me get 4 again, lastly the same
thing will happen.

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,960
I could say 4 through 10.

115
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
And it'll give me each one of those
numbers

116
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,850
with a little bit of random noise added
on.

117
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,540
So that's how I edit code, and that's how
I load the code into R.

118
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,800
Every time you edit your

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,810
file in the editor, you have to save it
and then if you want that code to

120
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,810
be available in R, you have to use the

121
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,260
source function to source that file back
into R.

122
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,950
You don't have to use a single file, you
can

123
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,580
add a new file, so you can say new script.

124
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,870
It'll open in another window, you can save
this to be a different file if you want.

125
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,920
So that way you can separate

126
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,340
code for different projects or different
assignments.

127
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,850
If you close the file here You can always
open it back

128
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,560
again by hitting, the open button and you
can see my code is right there.

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,270
And if I open it up, you'll see you'll
have all your code right back there again.

130
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,790
So that's how you edit code in R.

131
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:11,296
There's now there's many other text
editors that you might see on the web

132
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:15,480
that you can download, and those are fine
to use, but they're not really necessary.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,380
The text editor that comes with R should
be sufficient for this course.
