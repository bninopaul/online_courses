00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:19,675
So this is going to download and you want
to save it to somewhere on you hard drive.

5
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,645
Okay, once that's done downloading you
want to find

6
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:25,285
it on your computer and then open up the

7
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,925
setup package, which is an executable that
you

8
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:31,480
can double click and it'll start the setup
program.

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,060

You don't need eh, to modify the start up
options if you don't want to.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,030
and, creating a start up menu item is
usually a good idea.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,590
So, the, you hear the defaults are all
okay, once you

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,250

file start to install.

finish, and you'll notice that there is a

R icon on your desktop now, so you can
double-click on that icon to launch R,

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,300
