00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,220
I just want to make one quick note about
the

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,790
version of R that you'll be using in this
class.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,865
You might notice from some of the videos
that the videos are made using R

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:17,250
version 3.0.3, which was the most current
version at the time the video was made.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,204
However as of now, the most current
version of R is 3.1.1.

6
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:25,270
And so I encourage you to install that
version of R.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,760
Which should be the default version that
you find when you go to the R website.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,806
So don't try digging around for older
versions of R.

9
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:32,780
You won't need them.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,190
So I, in general, I always encourage
people to use the

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,980
latest version of software, because those
will have the latest features.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,050
And they will have hopefully fixed a bug

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,100
that may have been present in earlier
versions.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,570
So, for this version of the course use R
version 3.1.1.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,490
Thanks a lot.
