1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,580
In this case study, I'm going to talk more

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,870
about exploratory data analysis
techniques, and how to

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,060
use them, on a data set that involves

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,060
using smart phones, to, kind of, predict
human activities.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,120
So remember, just any exploratory data
analysis, you have to

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,350
have a sense of kind of like, what you're
looking for,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,970
what might, and what might be the kind of
the

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,930
key priorities that you want to get outta
your data set.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,220
And so that will help you guide kind of
what you looking at and how you

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,310
approach it um,remember that,the basic
idea

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,550
of exploratory data analysis is you want

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,840
to kind of produce a rough cut of the kind
of analysis that you

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,080
ultimately maybe want to do so maybe this
isn't going to be perfect

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,000
its not going to have all the right bells
and whistles to it.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,210
But it's going to give you a rough idea of
kind of what

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,610
in, kind of information you're going to be
able to extract out of

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,960
your data set and what kinds of questions
you're going to be

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,590
able to feasibly answer and, and what
questions might not really be possible

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,140
to answer with the given data set.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,130
So, so exploratory data analysis is really
important because it rules

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,330
out certain questions, and it kind of
pushes you along other directions.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,790
It really allows you to give you that
rough

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,870
cut analysis that can,can take you to the
next step.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,710
So let's take a look at the Samsung data

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,640
set in this example and see what we can
find.

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,790
So um,the data set here comes from the

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,150
University of California Irvine or U.C.I.
machine learning archive.

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,225
And it's based on predicting people's
movements.

29
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:33,730
be, from the Gal, from the Galaxy pho,
Samsung Galaxy phones.

30
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,448
So, here's a picture of the Samsung Galaxy
S3.

31
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:39,424
The actual data set was was produced using
the Galaxy

32
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,720
S2, and but the,the idea is kind of
basically the same.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,900
So, in each of these's, phones.

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,940
There's an accelerometer and a gyroscope.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,360
And so it helps you kind of, to understand
the

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,290
kind of three dimensional position and
acceleration of a person.

37
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,960
Assuming that they are holding their
phone.

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,220
So this is where the data set comes from.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,080
This is the UCI machine learning
repository.

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,400
you can go to the link to learn a little
bit more about the data set.

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,520
How it was collected, and kind of what is
available on the website.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,300
And so, we, I've downloaded

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,600
a subset of the data, which is just the

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,451
training data set for the purposes of this
lecture.

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,830
So the data been processed a little bit to
make it a little bit easier to use.

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,870
Basically you get a matrix, The, that has
kind of, has

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,480
the observations on the rows and the
various features on columns.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,770
And you see that at the bottom here, I've

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,280
got the activity label which is the kind
of the,

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,460
for each row that tells you what the
person was doing at that time.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,760
And so for example there is six possible
activities

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,500
that you can be doing; there's laying,
sitting, standing.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Walking, walking down and walking up.

54
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:51,170
And, the ideas that you, you want to

55
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,590
be able to kind of deter,separate out
these six

56
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,410
activities based on the many features that

57
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,040
are collected by the accelerometer and the
gyroscope.

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,530
And so

59
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,980
the, the I listed the first 12 features
here.

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,760
I can see that that they have body
acceleration as the mean

61
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,870
standard deviation, the mean absolute
deviation,

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,940
the maximum of each of these features.

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,070
So one thing we can do really quickly is
just

64
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,590
to look at the average acceleration for
the first subject.

65
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,960
So the first thing I'm going to do is

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,380
just, convert the activity variable into a
factor variable.

67
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,920
And then using the transform function.

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,930
And them I'm going to just subset out the
the first subject.

69
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,160
So subject equals one and I'm, for the
rest of this presentation

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm just going to ignore the rest of the
subjects for a moment.

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,430
Um,and so.

72
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,360
If I plot the first

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,850
subject, I can look at the first column,
and that's

74
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,790
the, first column is the body, the kind of
the body

75
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,300
excel over the mean body acceleration in
the x direction,

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,500
so acceleration's going to divide into
three dimensions, x, y, and z.

77
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,100
And then the second plot here is going to

78
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,860
be the, body excel, the mean body
acceleration

79
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,260
in the y direction and, and I've color

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,190
coded each of the, activities, by I'm
sorry.

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,570
I've color coded each of the activities.

82
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,840
So you can see for example, on the left
hand plot, that there's

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,260
green, there's red, black, blue and some

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,830
alternate activities so part of the
problem

85
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,540
with the left hand plot is that you can't
tell which activity is which,

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,150
so on the right hand plot, I added a
legend, using the legend function.

87
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,340
Just so you can figure out kind of which
Activities correspond to which color.

88
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,220
And so you can see that the green is

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,950
standing, the red is sitting, the black is
laying, etc.

90
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,950
And so you can see that, for example, the
mean body acceleration is ah,relatively

91
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,270
kind of uninteresting for things like
sit,standing and sitting and laying.

92
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,820
But for things like walking and working

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,630
down and walking up, there's much more
variability.

94
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,300
In the, in the mean body acceleration for
the x direction.

95
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,490
We can try to cluster the data, just on
the average acceleration.

96
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,870
So, I've taken just the first three
columns of this matrix,

97
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,320
and I calculated a distance matrix using
the DIST function.

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,020
And I'm using a Euclidean distance just as
the default.

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,900
And I can call the hclust function to

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,590
do, to do a hierarchical clustering of
these data.

101
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,390
And I've called this my plclust function
just to visualize it.

102
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,140
And you can see that the clustering is a
little bit messy.

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,880
And there isn't any kind of clear pattern
going on.

104
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,310
All the colors are kind of jumbled
together at the bottom.

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,890
And so we might need

106
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,130
to look a little bit further to try

107
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,080
and kind of extract more information out
of here.

108
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,050
Another thing we can look at is the

109
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,670
maximum acceleration for this, for the
first subject here.

110
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,980
And so I look at, I'm plotting here
columns ten and 11.

111
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,740
And and so you see that column ten is the
body, the maximum body acceleration in

112
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,260
the x direction, and, and column 11 is

113
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,630
the maximum body acceleration in the y
direction.

114
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,060
And so you can

115
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,670
see that again for things like laying and
standing

116
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,900
and sitting, there's not a lot of
interesting things going

117
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,760
on, but for walking in, and walking up,
and

118
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,680
walking down, the maximum acceleration
shows a lot of variability.

119
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,208
So that may,may be a predictor of those
kinds of activities.

120
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:07,220
But maybe early separating, kind of not
moving from

121
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,105
moving, which might be kind of obvious in
retrospect.

122
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,350
Um,so if you cluster

123
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,180
the data based on maximum acceleration,
you can see that there's two very clear

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,150
clusters on the left hand side, you've

125
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,530
got the, kind of the various walking
activities.

126
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,650
And on the right hand side you've got the

127
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,150
various, you know, non moving activities,
laying, standing, and sitting.

128
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,224
And so, beyond that, things are a little
bit jumbled together, you

129
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:31,050
can there's a lot of turquoise on the left
and so that's.

130
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,000
That's clearly one activity, but in the

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,910
blue and the kind of magenta kind of mixed
together.

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,333
And so,

133
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,755
a cluster based on maximum acceleration
seems to separate out moving

134
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:43,770
from non moving, but then once you get
within those clusters.

135
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,440
For example, within the moving cluster or

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,340
within the non moving cluster, um,then
it's

137
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,890
a little bit hard to tell what is what,
based just on maximum acceleration.

138
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,290
Um,we can try a little singular,singular
value decomposition

139
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,270
on this data, just to explore what's going
on.

140
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,020
Now before I do the SVD, I'm going to do

141
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,480
it on the entire matrix, which is 560
something um,columns.

142
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,940
I'm going to remove the last two, the last
two columns are just

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,540
the activity identifier and the subject

144
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,690
identifier which are not real interesting
data.

145
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,990
So I, I get rid of the five, the columns
562

146
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,950
and 63 and then I run the SVD on the data.

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,970
And you can see,

148
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,330
I'll take a look at the first and the

149
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,290
second left singular vectors and color
code them by activity.

150
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,910
And again, you can kind of see there's a
similar type of pattern.

151
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,750
The first singular vector really seems to

152
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,440
separate out the moving from the non
moving.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,490
So you can see that there's a, a kind of a
green, red, black on the bottom.

154
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,000
And the blue, turquoise, magenta on the
top.

155
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,410
And then the sec, the second singular
vector's a little bit somewhat a

156
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,960
little bit more vague, what it's looking
at.

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,920
It seems to be separating out The magenta
color from all the other clusters

158
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,890
and so I think this is the walking down,
or walking up one of those two.

159
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,860
And so it's not clear what is different
about that, that it

160
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,180
kind of highlights, that gets highlighted
on the second singular vector here.

161
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,200
So one of the things we can try to do

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,120
is try to find the maximum contribuators,
the, the contributor.

163
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,310
So in the second singular vector we, I'm
sorry, in the second right

164
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,530
singular vector, we can try to figure out
well which of these features

165
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,800
is kind of, is, is kind of producing the
most variation, or is

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,340
contributing to the most So the

167
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,250
variation between the various, the
different observations.

168
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,480
And so we

169
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,130
can, we can, we can use the which.max
function to figure

170
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,900
out okay, which of the 500 or so features
corresponds to

171
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,860
the, the, the kind of largest, or
contributes most of the

172
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,240
variations across observations, and I say
that to an object called maxContrib.

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,950
And then I'll cluster based on the maximum

174
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,340
acceleration plus this extra feature and
I'll, and I'll

175
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,580
calculate the distance matrix to run the h
plus function and you can see now the kind

176
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,770
of various activities seem to be
separating out a little bit

177
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,840
more, at least the three movement
activities have clearly been separated.

178
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,670
We've got the magenta, the dark blue and
the turquoise all

179
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,790
separated out the various non moving
activities seem to be all kind

180
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,432
of mixed together too so the, whatever
this maximum contributor happened to

181
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,990
be it didn't really help to separate out
the non moving activities.

182
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,020
But it seemed to help a lot in terms of
separating out the movement activities.

183
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,930
So, this max contributor was the body
acceleration, the mean

184
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,810
body acceleration in the frequency domain
for the z direction.

185
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,930
And so this was a, kind of the, the body
acceleration.

186
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,900
For the z direction where they applied and
you transform

187
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,510
and they give you the kind of frequency
components from that.

188
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,680
So that's kind of interesting.

189
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,315
We can try another clustering technique
here which is K-means clustering.

190
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,290
Ah,and one

191
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,350
of the things about k-means clustering
that you have

192
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,000
to be a little bit careful about is that
you

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,780
can get kind of different answers
depending on, you

194
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,060
know how many times,starting values you've
tried and how and

195
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,990
how often you run it so whenever you, when

196
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,960
you start k-means it has to chose a
starting point

197
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,500
for where the cluster centers are often it
will

198
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,230
just chose, most algorithms will chose a
random starting point.

199
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,150
So if you chose a random starting point

200
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,330
you may get to a solution that is
suboptimal.

201
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,330
So if you chose a different starting point
you may get

202
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,100
to an even better solution.

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,420
And so it's usually good to set the nstart
argument to be more than one so you can

204
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,880
start at many different starting points,
just so you

205
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,900
can get the optimal, or, a more optimal
solution.

206
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,290
So here is one clustering that we've done
with k-means.

207
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,830
And you can see that the, I've specified
six

208
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,450
centers, so I know that there are six
clusters.

209
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,710
So I'll just specify them right away.

210
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,120
And you can see that the,

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,340
some of the clusters kind of jumble
together.

212
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,080
So you can see cluster three is

213
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,970
a combination of laying, sitting, and
standing.

214
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,430
Whereas cluster one is walking, cluster,
clearly walking.

215
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,680
Cluster two is walking down.

216
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,940
Cluster four is walking up.
Cluster five is just walking.

217
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,340
And again, and cluster six is a mixture of
laying, sitting and standing.

218
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,460
And so you can see there, k-means here had
a little bit, had trouble separating

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,580
out also the laying, sitting and standing
from

220
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,390
the, the three, the in, in, in the
clusters.

221
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,540
If you try it again, you can see the
arrangement's a little bit different.

222
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,460
But again, cluster two for example It's a
mixture of

223
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,190
laying, sitting and standing, cluster five
similarly a mixture of sitting

224
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,350
and standing, but some of the, but the
other clusters

225
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,510
seem to, the other activities seem to
cluster out very, easily.

226
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,480
So now if

227
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,320
we try 100 different starting values, and
take you know,

228
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,281
take the, the most, the optimal solution
from this 100.

229
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,650
You see that things seem to separate out a

230
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,900
little bit better, not much better than
last time.

231
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,720
You can see cluster one is a mixture again
of laying, sitting, and standing.

232
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Cluster two is clearly laying.

233
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,112
Cluster three is clearly walking and
cluster four is walking down and

234
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,390
so you can see how these things kind of
cluster together and

235
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,270
I'll do a second try with 100 starting
values.

236
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,560
And you see, this is going to, probably
going to be our best effort.

237
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,580
And cluster six still is a mixture of
three

238
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,450
activities, and cluster five is a mixture
of two.

239
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,970
So you can see kind of, can see where the
kind of cluster centers are.

240
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,880
And the idea is that each of the clusters
Has a

241
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,830
mean value or a center in a, in this 500
dimensional space.

242
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,482
And so we can see kind of which features
of these 500

243
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:27,940
features seem to drive the location of the
center for that given cluster.

244
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,190
And then, that will help us, help give us
some idea of you know what features.

245
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,140
Seem to be important for classifying
people in

246
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,610
that cluster, or classifying observations
in that cluster.

247
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,170
So for in the first cluster here, which
seems to correspond to laying, you can see

248
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,660
that the center has a, a relatively high
value for a high, or positive values for

249
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,550
the first three features, which is kind of
the mean body acceleration.

250
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,639
And low values for some of the other
features.

251
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,780
I, It features,features four through ten.

252
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm only plotting the first ten here of
the 500 or so.

253
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,010
And then you see the second cluster here.

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,680
is, corresponds a little bit more, has,
has some more interesting values for

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,340
other Features so there's mean by

256
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,700
this mean acceleration there's also max
acceleration

257
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,330
that seems to have a kind of
subinteresting values.

258
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,620
So one of the things that you can do by
looking at the

259
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,000
cluster centers is to see well what

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,520
features seem to have interesting values
that

261
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,750
kind of drive the location to that center
And, which could give you a

262
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,800
hint, in terms of what features will be
most useful for predicting that activity.

263
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,217
So this is a just a short demonstration to
show how you can

264
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:40,570
take a large data set with lots of
features and lots of observations.

265
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,160
And start to explore it a little bit with
various clustering techniques.

266
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,410
We use Hierarchical clustering, use
k-means

267
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,490
clustering, and we use the singular

268
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,150
value composition to look at various
features of, of this data set.

269
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,420
So given what we've learned here, we may
want to be interested in

270
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,960
following up on kind of what's separates
out the various non movement activity.

271
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,020
So in terms of laying, sitting, and
standing, you know, we seem to

272
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,120
have some difficulty At least on the

273
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
first glance, separating those three
activities out.

274
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,800
The movement activities in terms of
walking.

275
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Walking up and walking down.

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,550
We seem to be able to kind of separate
those out into separate clusters.

277
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,680
Usually just a few variables most of them
max accelerations variables.

278
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,490
But the non movement kind of activities
seem to harder to separate out.

279
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,200
So, the nice thing about the exploratory
data analysis is that it gives

280
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,160
you this rough cut, that tells you kind of
where to spend your energy.

281
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,200
So, you probably don't, may not have to
spend too much

282
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,860
energy on the movement activities, but
maybe you need to spend, look,

283
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,670
dig a little bit deeper looking at the
kind of non movement activities.

284
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,580
So I hope you find this useful in terms of
how to get started using clustering

285
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,010
techniques and how to get a look at the
data and and,and kind of further your

286
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,700
analysis and,and to kind of get you going
for ah,more formal analysis.
